## Pro Tips for Claude Conversations

### 1. **Let Claude Delegate**
Don't specify which Director to use. Just state your need and let the VP Agent route it:
- ‚ùå "Career Director, help me with..."
- ‚úÖ "Help me plan my work presentation"

### 2. **Stay in Thinking Mode**
Claude defaults to thinking mode. Only explicitly request writing when ready:
- "Let's explore options for..." (thinking)
- "Write the final version of..." (writing)

### 3. **Build Context Over Time**
Each conversation adds to Claude's knowledge about you:
- "Remember that I prefer morning workouts"
- "Add to my project that we decided..."
- "Update my goals with..."

### 4. **Use Natural Language**
The PAI system understands context and intent:
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed with work"
- "Help me balance everything"
- "What should I focus on today?"

### 5. **Request Cross-Domain Insights**
The Meta Director can find patterns:
- "How is my health affecting my productivity?"
- "What patterns do you see across my life?"
- "Where should I focus for maximum impact?"
