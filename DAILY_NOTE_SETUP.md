### Idea Pipeline Management
- **Seeds** (Areas/Ideas/seeds/): New captures from daily notes
- **Developing** (Areas/Ideas/developing/): Ideas you're exploring
- **Validated** (Areas/Ideas/validated/): Ready for implementation

### Connection Building
- Use `[[]]` to link to existing notes
- Tag consistently: #idea, #meeting, #insight, #question
- Create Maps of Content (MOCs) monthly

## Automation Ideas

- **Weekend**: Personal/family focus

### Quick Capture
Set up quick capture:
1. Mobile: Obsidian mobile app + share sheet
