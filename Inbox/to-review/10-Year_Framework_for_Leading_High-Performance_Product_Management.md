   - Analyze concrete examples: Apple's focus on cash reserves and product line simplification under Jobs during 2008, Google's "20% time" preservation despite cost-cutting, and Amazon's contrarian expansion strategy during recession
   - Research specific regional cases: Nokia's team restructuring during the European sovereign debt crisis and Samsung's reorganization after the 1997 Asian financial crisis
   - Document specific patterns: Leadership transparency correlation with team cohesion, innovation pace during resource constraints, and communication frequency impact on team performance

2. **Identify core PM leadership competencies for institutional breakdown**
   - Interview specifically: Former product leaders from Blockbuster, BlackBerry, and Kodak about what worked/failed; product managers who maintained team cohesion during WeWork's collapse; PMs from Airbnb who navigated the 90% business drop during COVID
   - Conduct literature review focused on: "Antifragile" (Taleb), "Team of Teams" (McChrystal), "The Hard Thing About Hard Things" (Horowitz), "Winning Now, Winning Later" (Gorsky), and "Only the Paranoid Survive" (Grove)
