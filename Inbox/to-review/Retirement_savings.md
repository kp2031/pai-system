Growth rate needed to cover expenses in retirement with a 4% dividend 

To determine the required annual growth rate for your friend's retirement savings if he wants to use only a 4% dividend to cover his expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate annual expenses today**:
   \[
   \text{Annual expenses} = 15,000 \times 12 = 180,000 \, \text{USD}
   \]

2. **Adjust for taxes**:
   Since 60% of the withdrawals are taxed, your friend needs to withdraw more to cover the $180,000 post-tax expenses. Let \( W \) be the required withdrawal amount:
   \[
   0.4W = 180,000 \implies W = \frac{180,000}{0.4} = 450,000 \, \text{USD}
   \]

3. **Calculate future expenses with inflation**:
   The expenses will increase by 4% per year due to inflation. Let \( E_t \) be the expenses in year \( t \):
   \[
   E_t = 450,000 \times (1.04)^t
   \]

4. **Determine the number of years to retirement**:
   Assuming your friend wants to retire at age 65:
   \[
   \text{Years to retirement} = 65 - 43 = 22 \, \text{years}
   \]

5. **Future value of retirement expenses at retirement age**:
   \[
   E_{22} = 450,000 \times (1.04)^{22}
   \]

6. **Calculate the required retirement savings to generate a 4% dividend**:
   Let \( S \) be the required savings amount to generate the necessary dividend:
   \[
   0.04S = E_{22}
   \]

7. **Determine the future value needed**:
   \[
   S = \frac{E_{22}}{0.04}
   \]

8. **Calculate the required annual growth rate**:
   Your friend has $170,000 in retirement savings today. To find the required annual growth rate \( r \), we use the future value formula:
   \[
   170,000 \times (1 + r)^{22} = S
   \]

Let's calculate these values step by step.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Step 1: Calculate future annual expenses in 22 years
\[
E_{22} = 450,000 \times (1.04)^{22}
\]
\[
E_{22} \approx 450,000 \times 2.393 = 1,076,850 \, \text{USD}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate the required retirement savings to generate a 4% dividend
\[
S = \frac{1,076,850}{0.04}
\]
\[
S = 26,921,250 \, \text{USD}
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the required growth rate
\[
170,000 \times (1 + r)^{22} = 26,921,250
\]

\[
(1 + r)^{22} = \frac{26,921,250}{170,000}
\]

\[
(1 + r)^{22} \approx 158.36
\]

\[
1 + r \approx (158.36)^{\frac{1}{22}}
\]

\[
1 + r \approx 1.238
\]

\[
r \approx 0.238 = 23.8\%
\]

### Summary

Your friend needs an annual growth rate of approximately 23.8% before tax in his retirement savings account to generate enough savings to cover his future monthly expenses using only a 4% dividend, considering a 60% tax rate on withdrawals and a 4% annual inflation rate.
