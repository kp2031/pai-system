Each prompt below is tailored for your AI coding agent to build a focused implementation plan on the corresponding tip.

1. Landing Page Quality
		Deep dive into why high-quality, professional landing pages are essential for product credibility and conversions. Outline actionable steps and tools to design a landing page that stands out, avoiding generic or rushed designs. Provide a project plan and checklist for achieving top-tier landing page quality.

2. Unique Design Details
		Analyze how to add subtle, human-like details to web designs to make them appear premium and non-generic. Suggest techniques, design practices, and AI prompts to achieve unique looks that set the site apart from typical AI-generated templates. Deliver a plan for identifying and implementing creative touches.

3. Leverage Proven Prompts and Code
		Deep dive into the process of studying, copying, and adapting successful prompts and code from expert designers or open-source projects. Explain how to extract, test, and refactor these resources for your own use with AI coding agents, providing actionable steps to maximize their effectiveness.

4. Guide AI to Use Advanced Design Libraries (Paper Shaders for Backgrounds)
		Break down the steps to integrate advanced background libraries (like Paper Shaders) into a web project by instructing an AI coding agent. Detail how to prompt the agent for library installation, configuration, design customization, and troubleshooting for visually impressive animated backgrounds.

5. Use Animation Libraries (Framer Motion for React)
		Outline a plan to implement all interactive and animated elements using professional libraries such as Framer Motion for React. Provide prompts to configure, test, and optimize animations so they are smooth, maintainable, and avoid custom hand-coding wherever possible.

6. Request Specific Animation Effects (Rotating Circles, Gooey Morphing)
		Detail how to prompt the AI coding agent to build specific animation effects—such as rotating circles and gooey morphing—using Framer Motion or similar libraries. Provide instructions for breaking down the effect, composing reusable components, and ensuring quality and performance.

7. Font Customization and Experimentation
		Describe a plan to select, import, and apply unique fonts (e.g., Google Fonts) to improve site character. Guide the AI agent with prompts for targeted font usage on specific words or sections, and offer a checklist for quality and accessibility testing.

8. Utilize Unique Layouts from Design Galleries (Landbook)
		Instruct the AI agent to reference designs from professional galleries like Landbook. Provide steps to select, document, and adapt unique layouts and mapping styles. Detail how to prompt for screenshot analysis, layout reproduction, and customization for product fit.

9. Use SVGs for Logos and Icons
		Guide the AI coding agent to implement logos and icons using SVG code instead of images. Give actionable prompts for acquiring, customizing, and animating SVGs (e.g., with Framer Motion). Ensure the plan covers integration, accessibility, and branding best practices.

10. SVG Illustration Resources
		Detail a workflow for supplying and editing SVG illustration assets through the AI agent. Include prompts for easy color/shape modifications and guidance for matching the illustrations to your brand’s identity and landing page needs.

Use each one as a single, focused deep-dive prompt with your AI coding agent for step-by-step implementation planning.
