can you please add continuous build testing or unit testing or whatever makes sense into the planning files
  so the ios app is constantly being tested to make sure it builds successfully and all errors get fixed after every
  feature branch is worded on and the build is successful before updating github.

can we also make sure that all the planning files and all the md files understand what their role is? can you think hard
   about which one of the planning files is the one that i prompt as the master plan file to keep going? so the master
  plan file should be aware of all the sub-planning files that were created and each of the sub planning files should be
  aware of each other and the master plan file so they know how to gracefully build this app together and hand off and
  prepare for the next phase. does this make sense. it seems like there are a lot of planning md files, can you make sure
  they're all updated so they all know our most current plan of how we want to keep evolving the app? they should all have
   the latest planning methodology, like build testing and fixing all errors before updating github. and best practices
  like creating feature branches etc.

let's keep planning. no code. ultrathink. Can we capture the Advanced Learning Opportunities in a parkinglot of ideas MD
   file to consider at a future time, not now. one of the insights I want to share is that people love seeing a before and
   after - and i think it'll be even more powerful to show a generic AI generated script with our personalized script side
   by side. this way, they have a reinforcing feeling that the work they're putting into the app is being used to
  personalize their inputs. what i mean is, imagine a super robotic and generic script that any AI would output on the
  left, and then right beside it, we wirte out, character by character, super fast, our app version, the personalized
  version based on our knowledge of the user from past rehearsals, or even the options they've picked when entering their
  first inputs like context e.g. business meeting vs. wedding speech. It would be powerful to show a script on the left,
  the generic ai robotic script on the left because this way the user understands that if they just type in their bullets
  into any free ai tool, that's the output they'll get, basic, generic. let's make sure we're not insulting the basic,
  generic script, but what we can say is that it's something like a "Raw Script Draft" and then ours would be the
  "Personalized Script Draft" that takes in the inputs like context, etc. can you ultrathink about how we can build this
  type of side by side experience so the user really feels the value of the app? and the more they use the app, the more
  personalized it gets. and so think about how the most efficient way to capture a users inputs and feedback would be,
  starting at this first draft stage. and i like the idea of the generic robotic sounding ai raw script to be annimated
  fast, sentance by sentance and then as soon as the first 10 sentances are presented to the user on the left, our
  personalized side on the right starts annimating single charachter by character, and animated at a quarter the speed, so
   it feels like the app is taking the time to personalize the script for the user, slowly and thoughtfully. can you
  please ultrathink about how we do this and how we can best integrate this into the script review experience? i feel the
  script review page / view is one of the most important to win the heart of the user because that's where they'll see the
   difference of using our app that helps them personalize the generic outputs any old LLM ai would output.
