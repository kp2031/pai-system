# Prompt for book summaries

Hi there, can you please summarize this book: “it doesn’t have to be crazy at work”. 
Please extract to your best abilities the 5 key takeaways per chapter for each chapter. Please let me know at the beginning how many chapters there are and the titles of each chapter before beginning the chapter take always. If there are examples in the book, please share them in the chapter summaries after the key 5 takeaways.
