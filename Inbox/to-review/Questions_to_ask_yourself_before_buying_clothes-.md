2. How does it feel?
3. Do I already own something like this? If yes, how often do I wear it?
4. If the item is on sale, would I pay full price for it?
5. What would you be prepared to let go? (Assuming you're using the rule of 50 max items (excluding socks, underwear and gym clothes)
6. What 5 items would this work with?
7. Does this type of dress match the type of events that I go to?
8. Is this my style or somebody else's style?
9. Is it easy to clean?
