# Mark’s 40th

Mark’s 40th

Dear Mark,

Happy happy 40th Birthday! 

I am very lucky that over the past many years to have gotten to know you better at a deeper personal level. I wanted to share 3 things that I have learnt from you, appreciate and admire about you.

The first thing I try to learn from you is how you are Thoughtfully-Minimalist. Not a minimalist for the sake of it, but you take each decision of buying something and go back to first principles about what the this is for, how much it cost and how often you’ll use it. You take this very thoughtful approach not just to buying stuff, but how you live your life, and I’m inspired by this.

The second thing that I would say I got to know most with time is how you are Privately-Generous. This is something that you get to know about someone over years and I really got to know how generous you are with us and welcoming with open arms every time. And you don’t do it in a big and boastful way like most people do, it is quiet and private and that I really respect about you.

The last is how Perseveringly-Focused. You have been able to stay on course with the military and perform all your duties while being focused on being a good dad and taking care of your family. You have persevered through the tough traveling and deployments to be focused on what you set out to achieve. You’ve been able to layer in going to school over the years and kept moving forward with your plan to grow yourself, your family and your career. I am definitely the most proud of you and look up to you about this.

These are only 3 of the many things that I and we love about you.

Lots of love, 

Kavi.
