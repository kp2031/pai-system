# Announcement 

I wanted to share some exciting news about Yatin, who will be transitioning from our Canada business to the international business in the role of Sr. Manager International Analytics Implementation. Yatin’s move to California is a natural progression, reflecting the great work and leadership he has brought to our team. Though he’ll be taking on this new role, Yatin will continue to lead our group, maintaining the momentum and positive trajectory we’ve built together.

This transition is an exciting opportunity for us to extend our impact, and I am confident in our ability to continue thriving. The team will now report directly to me, and I look forward to supporting you all as we navigate this new chapter. Please join me in congratulating Yatin on this next step in his journey!
