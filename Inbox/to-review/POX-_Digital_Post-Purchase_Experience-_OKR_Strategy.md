# POX: Digital Post-Purchase Experience: OKR Strategy

**## POX: Digital Post-Purchase Experience: OKR Strategy**
**## Introduction**
**
**
An exceptional **post-purchase customer experience** is crucial for driving loyalty and repeat business. In fact, even one broken post-purchase interaction (e.g. lack of updates or a difficult return) can turn a new customer into a detractor, whereas a smooth post-purchase journey can turn one-time buyers into lifelong loyalists _linkedin.com_. This strategy focuses on Walmart Canada’s **digital post-purchase experience portfolio** – encompassing order tracking, delivery updates, returns/refunds, and customer communications – as a powerful lever to improve Net Promoter Score (NPS), build trust, and enhance operational excellence. Research shows that optimizing post-purchase touchpoints directly boosts customer satisfaction and loyalty: for example, keeping customers informed at every step *“cultivates trust, which leads to deeper loyalty, higher NPS, and stronger revenue.”* _linkedin.com_ _linkedin.com_

To ensure **clarity, customer empathy, and measurable value**, we organize initiatives into **three customer-centric themes** reflecting how shoppers experience post-purchase interactions:
* **1. Transparent Order Tracking & Delivery** – Customers asking *“Where’s my order?”* want real-time visibility and confidence from purchase to delivery.
* **2. Seamless Returns & Refunds** – Customers thinking *“I want to return or exchange my item”* expect easy, frictionless resolution of issues.
* **3. Proactive Communication & Engagement** – Customers who say *“Keep me informed and help me as needed”*value timely notifications, personalized support, and responsive engagement after purchase.

Each theme below includes a **validated Objective** with 3–5 **Key Results (KRs)** aligned to NPS uplift, customer trust, and operational excellence, followed by **high-impact product/design initiatives** (10–20 per theme). These initiatives integrate best practices in Generative AI, personalization at scale, automation, conversational UX, and modern customer engagement to deliver clear customer value. This comprehensive OKR framework will act as an internal roadmap for Walmart Canada’s product teams to elevate the post-purchase experience into a driver of loyalty and growth.
**## Post-Purchase Themes and Scope**
For clarity, the table below maps the three themes to key post-purchase features in Walmart Canada’s portfolio:
|  **Theme**<br/> | **Customer Need & Scope of Features**<br/> |
|-----|-----|
|  **1. Transparent Order Tracking & Delivery** <br/>*(“Where’s my order?”)*<br/> | Real-time order status updates on web/app, live order tracking (e.g. map view of delivery), order details pages, delivery confirmations, and related in-transit information. Covers all features that keep customers informed from checkout until package delivery.<br/> |
|  **2. Seamless Returns & Refunds** <br/>*(“I want to return or exchange.”)*<br/> | Online return initiation for web orders, self-service returns flow, automated refund processing, “keep-it” return options (refund without return), and exchanges. Encompasses all digital touchpoints to resolve post-purchase issues like returns or replacements quickly and painlessly.<br/> |
|  **3. Proactive Communication & Engagement** <br/>*(“Keep me updated and involved.”)*<br/> | Transactional communications across email, SMS, and push notifications (order confirmation, shipment/delivery notices, return status, etc.), personalized post-purchase content, conversational customer support (chatbots/voice assistants), and loyalty or feedback engagement after purchase.<br/> |

**## Theme 1: Transparent Order Tracking & Delivery Experience**
**Customer POV:** *“I want to know exactly where my order is and trust it will arrive on time.”* Anxious waiting is natural after placing an order – customers crave clarity and transparency about their delivery. This theme focuses on **real-time order tracking, delivery updates, and the order details experience** that reassure customers and eliminate the “Where is my order?” anxiety. By delivering up-to-the-minute information through user-friendly tracking tools, Walmart Canada can reduce customer frustration and build trust. A strong tracking experience not only improves NPS by delighting customers with convenience, but also reduces operational costs (fewer calls/emails to customer service asking about order status) _wismolabs.com_. Notably, customers check order status frequently – on average 3–6 times per shipment _wismolabs.com_ – indicating high engagement and a prime opportunity to reinforce brand reliability at each check-in.
**## Objective & Key Results – *****## “Deliver end-to-end transparency and confidence in the delivery process.”*****## 
**
**Objective:** **Provide Walmart Canada customers with a seamless, transparent order tracking experience that minimizes uncertainty and builds confidence** from purchase to delivery.
**Key Results (by end of FY2025):**

* **KR1: NPS Improvement –** Increase **post-purchase NPS** (specifically for the delivery/tracking phase) from **X to Y**(a significant uptick), reflecting greater customer satisfaction with delivery updates _linkedin.com_ _linkedin.com_.
* **KR2: Customer Trust –** Achieve **95%+ of orders delivered with *****no customer “Where Is My Order” calls*** or chats. (Baseline: e.g. 85%; this reduction in WISMO inquiries indicates customers feel well-informed _wismolabs.com_.)
* **KR3: Engagement –** **Increase customer engagement with tracking tools**: e.g. ≥ **70% of customers use the online tracking page or app at least once per order** (and find it useful), and ≥ **50% use the live tracking map**when available. Higher usage signifies that the tools are accessible and valued.
* **KR4: Operational Excellence –** **Improve delivery information accuracy** and speed: e.g. **98% of shipments have correct, real-time status updates** (no missing or outdated info), and **100% of delay or exception events trigger a customer update within 15 minutes**. This ensures transparency even when things go wrong, helping customers “tolerate longer-than-expected timelines” through proactive honesty _linkedin.com_.
* **KR5: Trust & Loyalty –** **Increase repeat purchase intent related to delivery experience**: e.g. raise the rate of customers who say *“I will shop again because of the great delivery experience”* to **Z%** in post-delivery surveys. (This ties delivery satisfaction to loyalty behavior.)

**## Key Initiatives for Order Tracking & Delivery Transparency**
To achieve the above OKRs, the following **product and design initiatives** are recommended. These initiatives emphasize **real-time data, intuitive design, automation, and AI** to keep customers informed and confident:
1. **Branded Order Tracking Portal:** Create a **Walmart-branded tracking page** (web and in-app) that customers can visit for real-time order status. Instead of sending customers to generic carrier websites, the Walmart Canada tracking portal will display current status (e.g. “Shipped”, “Out for Delivery”) with **clear visuals and branding**. A branded tracking experience not only reduces buyer anxiety but also reinforces the Walmart brand and opens opportunities to upsell/cross-sell while customers await their order _wismolabs.com_ _wismolabs.com_. (Near-term benefit: **elevates customer experience and NPS** by providing a pleasant, informative interface _linkedin.com_.)
2. **Live Map Tracking:** Implement **live order tracking on a map** for deliveries in regions where real-time courier GPS is available (e.g. same-day grocery or home delivery). Customers can watch the delivery vehicle’s progress and see an estimated arrival time that updates dynamically. This interactive, **conversational UX** (e.g. “Your order is 5 stops away”) dramatically increases transparency and reduces the need to ask “where is my order,” since the answer is visible in real time.
3. **Enhanced Order Details Page:** Redesign the **order details page** in the user’s account/app to be a one-stop hub for all post-purchase info. Key features: a timeline of the order’s journey (ordered → processed → shipped → out for delivery → delivered), tracking numbers with status, delivery date estimates, and links to actions like “Contact support” or “Initiate a return” next to each item. The page should be **mobile-friendly and clear**, using icons or progress bars to communicate status at a glance. By making order details easily accessible and comprehensible, we ensure customers never feel “out of the loop” about their purchase _linkedin.com_.
4. **Proactive Delivery Updates (Automation):** Set up **automated push/SMS/email notifications** at key shipment milestones – e.g. *“Your order has shipped!”*, *“Out for delivery today”*, *“Delivered at your doorstep”*. Given that **88% of consumers desire order progress notifications** _wismolabs.com_, providing these updates meets a clear customer need. Even more crucially, if any delay or exception occurs, trigger an immediate **proactive alert**apologizing and giving a new ETA. Customers prefer to know about a delay rather than be left in the dark _linkedin.com_ _linkedin.com_. By automating these communications (and integrating with Theme 3’s communication platform), Walmart can **“keep shoppers informed” and thereby cultivate trust** even when things go wrong _linkedin.com_.
5. **AI-Powered Delivery Estimates:** Leverage **AI/ML (machine learning)** to improve delivery date predictions displayed to customers. Using historical logistics data, the system can provide more accurate **estimated delivery dates** (or time windows) at order checkout and update them in real time on the tracking page. This manages expectations better – if an item is delayed, the AI-adjusted ETA will reflect that proactively. Greater accuracy in delivery promises will increase trust (customers feel Walmart “keeps its promises”) and reduce frustration caused by late deliveries.
6. **“Where Is My Order?” Chatbot:** Deploy a **conversational AI assistant** that can handle common post-purchase queries like “When will my order arrive?” or “Has my package shipped?”. This could be integrated into the Walmart Canada app/website and messaging channels. Using **Generative AI** with access to order data, the chatbot can understand natural language questions and generate clear answers (e.g. “Your order is in transit and expected by tomorrow, April 23”). This 24/7 self-service tool not only provides instant answers (improving customer satisfaction) but also deflects contacts from call centers (boosting operational efficiency).
7. **In-Transit Engagement Content:** Enrich the tracking experience by providing **useful content while customers wait**. For example, if a customer bought a complex product (electronics, furniture, etc.), the order tracking page or confirmation email can show **personalized tips, setup guides, or how-to videos** for that item _linkedin.com_ _linkedin.com_. (This was effectively used by Sonos, which turned tracking pages into onboarding guides, accelerating customers’ time-to-value with their product _linkedin.com_.) Such content shows empathy – we care that the customer succeeds with the product – and can preempt returns (customer feels more comfortable and educated). It’s a form of **personalization at scale**: tailoring post-purchase info to what each customer bought.
8. **Multi-Channel Order Tracking (Voice & Chat):** Extend tracking capabilities to modern channels for convenience. For instance, integrate with voice assistants – *“Alexa, ask Walmart Canada where my order is”* – and ensure it can provide the status. Similarly, allow customers to **text or use WhatsApp for order status** (the chatbot from #6 can be extended here). Meeting customers on their preferred channels with consistent info is part of modern customer engagement and reduces effort on the customer’s part (**customer effort score** improves as they can simply ask and get answers on the go).
9. **Self-Service Delivery Issue Reporting:** Build a **self-service flow for delivery issues**. If a package is marked delivered but the customer didn’t receive it, or if it’s delayed beyond a certain threshold, the tracking page or app can present a “Report an Issue” button. This triggers a guided process (possibly via chatbot or form) to resolve common problems – e.g. start an investigation with the carrier, initiate a reshipment, or offer a quick coupon as goodwill for a delay. Automating this flow shows proactive customer care, turning potential detractors into neutral or positive outcomes by addressing problems swiftly without the customer needing to call support.
10. **Delivery Confirmation & Feedback Prompt:** After the order is delivered, send a confirmation (via notification and on the tracking page) that clearly indicates successful delivery (including details like who signed or photo proof if available). On the **order details page**, display a **feedback prompt**: e.g. “How was your delivery experience?” with a quick 1-5 star or thumbs-up/down input. If the feedback is negative (or if the customer indicates an issue like “package damaged”), automatically route that into a service recovery workflow (alert support or trigger an instant apology message with next steps). Capturing this feedback not only closes the loop for dissatisfied customers but provides Walmart data on carrier performance and customer satisfaction at the delivery phase (supporting continuous improvement, ties to NPS metric).

By executing these initiatives, **Theme 1** will reassure customers that once they’ve clicked “Buy”, Walmart Canada has their back. The combination of **real-time tracking, proactive updates, and convenient self-service tools** will significantly reduce uncertainty and anxiety. Customers who feel informed and in control are far more likely to trust the retailer and purchase again _linkedin.com_ _linkedin.com_ – directly contributing to higher NPS and greater lifetime value for Walmart Canada.

**## Theme 2: Seamless Returns & Refunds**
**Customer POV:** *“I need to return this item or get a refund – I hope it’s easy and fair.”* Even after a successful delivery, a subset of purchases will result in returns or issues (wrong item, not as expected, etc.). How Walmart Canada handles returns and refunds is a **make-or-break moment for trust and loyalty**. A hassle-filled return process can turn a previously happy customer into a detractor, whereas a seamless, “no questions asked” return experience shows customers that Walmart stands behind its products and values their convenience. **Ease of returns** is directly tied to future purchase decisions – surveys have found **96% of shoppers would shop again with a retailer if the return process is “easy”** _digitalcommerce360.com_ _digitalcommerce360.com_, and clear return policies make 92% of customers more likely to buy in the first place _agilitypr.com_. This theme therefore emphasizes **self-service, speed, and generosity** in the returns/refunds process, aiming to turn a potentially negative situation into a positive, trust-building interaction.
**## Objective & Key Results – *****## “Make returns and refunds effortless, building customer trust through fairness and speed.”*****## 
**
**Objective:** **Offer an industry-leading easy returns experience** for Walmart Canada’s e-commerce customers, **minimizing friction and maximizing trust** when things don’t work out.
**Key Results (by end of FY2025):**

* **KR1: NPS (Returns) –** Achieve an **NPS of at least X** among customers who go through a return/refund process (measured via follow-up survey), up from baseline of Y. (Aim to make the returns experience a positive differentiator rather than a pain point). Given that 95%+ of customers will repurchase if returns are satisfactory _digitalcommerce360.com_ _digitalcommerce360.com_, a high returns NPS will bolster overall loyalty.
* **KR2: Return Process Satisfaction –** Increase the **post-purchase CSAT for “ease of return” to ≥ 90%** (via feedback collected after return completion). For example, aim for 90% of respondents to agree that “The return process was easy” (currently e.g. 70%). This indicates frictionless execution and customer-friendly policies.
* **KR3: Self-Service Utilization –** **80%+ of eligible returns are initiated and completed through self-service**digital channels (website or app) without requiring call/chat support. (Baseline e.g. 50%.) This indicates customers are finding the online return tools intuitive and effective – a win for customer empowerment and operational efficiency (fewer manual interventions).
* **KR4: Speed of Refund –** **Reduce average refund turnaround time to 2 days** (from item return to refund issuance), down from current average of X days. Additionally, target **95% of refunds processed within 5 days** of return initiation. Faster refunds delight customers and demonstrate operational excellence, turning a potentially frustrating wait into a quick resolution.
* **KR5: Cost & Efficiency –** Implement **“return optimization”** to save costs while improving experience: e.g. **X% reduction in return shipping or processing cost** per return (via automation or returnless refunds), and **Y% reduction in repeat contacts about return status issues**. Efficient handling means fewer customer complaints and lower operational overhead, all while maintaining trust.

**## Key Initiatives for Seamless Returns & Refunds**
To accomplish these KRs, Walmart Canada should execute the following **initiatives focusing on self-service design, policy innovation, and intelligent automation**. These initiatives also incorporate **AI and personalization** to make returns smarter and more customer-centric:
1. **Online Self-Service Returns Portal:** Launch a **comprehensive returns portal** on the Walmart Canada website and app. Customers should be able to view their recent orders, select items to return, specify return reasons, and get instant authorization – all without agent involvement. The interface will guide users step-by-step (e.g. select reason from a dropdown, choose refund or replacement). By making returns as easy as a few clicks, we address the 69% of consumers who expect an easy-to-follow returns process _agilitypr.com_ _agilitypr.com_. Clear instructions and progress indicators will reduce confusion and effort.
2. **Instant Return Labels / QR Codes:** Provide **immediate return shipping solutions**. After a customer submits a return request online, the system generates a pre-paid **return shipping label** (PDF) and also a **mobile QR code** that can be scanned at carrier drop-off locations (so customers without a printer aren’t stuck). This mirrors best-in-class practices (e.g. Amazon’s QR code drop-off). Automation here speeds up the process – the customer doesn’t wait for email approval; it’s instant. The convenience of hassle-free drop-off will be reflected in higher CSAT for returns.
3. **“Keep It” Return Option (Returnless Refunds):** Implement a policy for low-cost or certain unsellable items where the customer is **offered a refund without needing to physically return the product**. Using business rules and AI to identify when return shipping/logistics cost outweigh product value (e.g. a $10 item), the system can automatically present a “no return needed” resolution – essentially *“Keep the item, your refund is on its way.”* This not only delights customers (an unexpected gesture of goodwill) but also saves Walmart significant handling costs _wismolabs.com_. Proper controls (like frequency limits or value thresholds) will prevent abuse, and it can be framed as a sustainability initiative (avoid needless shipping).
4. **Fast Refund Processing (Automation):** Speed is critical in turning a return into a positive memory. Walmart Canada should invest in **automating the refund process** end-to-end. For example, as soon as a return package is scanned by the carrier or dropped off, trigger the refund issuance (rather than waiting for warehouse receipt). Alternatively, use **instant refunds to gift card or store credit** at the moment of return initiation for top customers or certain cases. The goal is the customer sees their refund processed *within 0-2 days*, which greatly increases satisfaction. (If immediate refund is not viable for all cases, at least communicate a clear timeline and meet it reliably.)
5. **Easy Exchanges & Store Credit Incentives:** Encourage customers to opt for an **exchange or store credit** instead of a refund, when appropriate, to retain revenue in the ecosystem. The returns portal can present an option: e.g. “Would you like to exchange for a different size/color?” or “Get an instant refund as Walmart credit + a bonus $5 for your next purchase.” Many customers will take an incentive, which turns a return into a repurchase opportunity _corp.narvar.com_. Make sure the exchange process is as frictionless as return (ship new item right away, withhold charging until old item is shipped back, etc.). This initiative drives operational excellence by reducing net losses from returns and can improve NPS by showing flexibility.
6. **Conversational Return Assistant:** Integrate a **Generative AI-powered chatbot** specifically trained on return policies and procedures. Customers can simply type (or speak) something like “I want to return an item I bought” and the conversational assistant will gather the necessary info (order number, item, reason) in a friendly Q&A manner, then initiate the return on their behalf. This **conversational UX** caters to those who prefer a chat-style interaction over forms. It also allows for nuanced questions – e.g. “It’s past the return window, what can I do?” – where the AI can gracefully handle exceptions or escalate to a human with context. The assistant should be available 24/7 on the returns page and via messaging apps, providing empathetic, instant help.
7. **Personalized Return Policies (Loyalty-Based):** Implement **tiered return experiences** as a form of personalization at scale. For example, loyalty program members or customers with a strong history could get an extended return window or free return shipping as a perk. New customers might see a standard 30-day policy, while top-tier members see “60-day hassle-free returns for VIP members” – fostering loyalty by rewarding customer value. Additionally, if the AI detects a customer has had multiple recent returns (potential dissatisfaction), the system could proactively reach out with a concierge-like service (“We noticed you returned a few items – is there anything we can help with?”) to show extra care.
8. **Transparency in Policy & Status:** Ensure **return/refund policies are crystal clear and communicated upfront**. On product pages and at checkout, prominently display “Free & easy returns within 30 days” (or whatever the policy is), as this can increase purchase confidence _agilitypr.com_. Post-purchase, reiterate the return options in order confirmation and package inserts. Also, **provide status tracking for returns** analogous to order tracking – e.g. a customer who sent back an item can see “Return in transit”, “Return received by warehouse”, “Refund processed on X date” on their order details. This transparency eliminates the uncertainty of “did they get my return?” and again reduces calls. It aligns with the earlier principle: keeping the customer informed builds trust _linkedin.com_, even in the reverse logistics process.
9. **Return Analytics & Product Feedback Loop:** Use data from return reasons to drive improvements. The returns portal should collect standardized reasons (too small, not as described, etc.) and allow optional customer comments. Implement an **AI analytics tool** to sift through this data and identify patterns – e.g. a particular apparel item has 30% returns citing “size too small,” indicating a sizing chart issue. Feed these insights to merchandising teams to fix product descriptions or quality, thereby **reducing future returns at the source** _wismolabs.com_ _wismolabs.com_. This is an operational excellence win – fewer returns mean lower costs and happier customers. Additionally, this data-driven approach can measure an ultimate key result: *reduction in return rate* due to these fixes (e.g. return rate drops X% after addressing top reasons).
10. **Integration of Online & In-Store Returns:** For Walmart Canada’s omnichannel convenience, ensure digital purchases can be returned in physical stores seamlessly. From a digital product perspective, that means generating QR codes or return IDs that store associates can scan to process the return quickly (no paper receipt needed). Also, allow customers to **schedule a curbside return** through the app (similar to grocery pickup, they drive up and hand off return). While operationally this crosses into store processes, the digital experience to enable it is key. Offering multiple return channels – ship it back, drop in store, curbside – gives customers flexibility (a hallmark of modern customer experience _agilitypr.com_) and shows empathy for their convenience.
11. **Fraud and Abuse Prevention via AI:** While making returns easy, guard against abuse with backend **AI fraud detection** (Walmart’s scale generates ample data to train models on return patterns). For instance, flag if someone is habitually returning high-value items after use, or making false “item not received” claims. Implementing this isn’t customer-facing, but it protects the business so that generous policies can remain in place for honest customers. The system can require additional verification or limits for flagged cases, while genuine customers continue to enjoy frictionless returns. This balances customer empathy with operational prudence.
12. **Customer Care Follow-up on Returns:** For any return that could not be fully automated or where an issue occurred (e.g. delayed refund beyond the promised time), set up a **proactive customer care outreach**. A simple email or call saying “We noticed a delay/problem with your return, we’re on it” can preempt frustration. Using automation, we can trigger such follow-ups based on exceptions (like if refund not issued after X days). This ties back to trust – showing Walmart is actively monitoring and ensuring no return falls through the cracks.

Through these initiatives, **Theme 2** aims to transform returns from a source of customer frustration into an opportunity to **show customers we care**. A truly seamless returns process demonstrates to customers that *“we really care about you”* – which is exactly what drives loyalty in today’s experience-driven market _agilitypr.com_ _agilitypr.com_. By making returns easy, fast, and even delightful, Walmart Canada will strengthen customer trust (they know they won’t be stuck with something unwanted) and encourage them to shop with confidence (knowing any issue is hassle-free to resolve). The payoff is higher customer retention and positive word-of-mouth, as studies have shown: *“96% of shoppers will return to a business with ‘easy’ returns.”* _digitalcommerce360.com_ This is not just service recovery, but a strategic investment in lifetime customer value.

**## Theme 3: Proactive Communication & Engagement**
**Customer POV:** *“Keep me updated after my purchase, and make me feel valued – not forgotten.”* This theme covers the **outbound and two-way communications** that occur from the moment an order is placed through post-delivery. It includes order confirmation emails, shipment and delivery notifications via email/SMS/push, and any personalized follow-ups (like asking for a review, or suggesting related products). Modern customers expect **timely, relevant, and personalized communication** across channels – indeed, *88% of consumers want proactive notifications on order progress* _wismolabs.com_. When done right, these communications **build trust** (the customer feels the brand is transparent and caring), and can even drive additional engagement and sales (through personalization and loyalty programs). Furthermore, incorporating **conversational and AI-driven engagement** means customers can interact with Walmart (ask questions, get help) easily, increasing satisfaction. This theme ensures Walmart Canada doesn’t go silent after the sale, but rather continues the conversation, fostering a relationship that extends well beyond the initial purchase.
**## Objective & Key Results – *****## “Keep customers informed and engaged in a personalized, timely manner that strengthens loyalty.”*****## 
**
**Objective:** **Deliver proactive, personalized communications** throughout the post-purchase journey that make customers feel supported, informed, and appreciated, thereby deepening their trust in Walmart Canada.
**Key Results (by end of FY2025):**

* **KR1: NPS (Communication) –** Improve **overall NPS by +X points** attributable to post-purchase communications (measured by tagging NPS feedback related to “kept informed” sentiment). Essentially, more customers should cite good communication as a reason for high ratings. Also track a **Trust Score**: e.g. increase the percentage of customers who agree “Walmart kept me well-informed about my order” from Y% to **Y+20%** _linkedin.com_.
* **KR2: Engagement Metrics –** Achieve **open rates of ≥% and click-through of ≥% on transactional emails**, and **opt-in rates of ≥% for SMS/push**. (These numbers indicate customers find value in our communications and are willing to receive them, rather than ignoring or unsubscribing. High engagement means the content/timing is relevant.) For instance, aim for an order shipment notification email open rate of >80%, and push notification opt-in among app users of >60%.
* **KR3: Personalization & Loyalty Impact –** **Increase repeat purchase rate by Y%** among customers who engage with post-purchase communications (vs. those who don’t). Also, track that **≥ 50% of post-purchase messages include personalized content** (product recommendations, customer’s name, related offers). The goal is to demonstrably link personalized engagement to more revenue or higher customer Lifetime Value. For example, if currently 30% of customers make a second purchase within 3 months, target 35% with improved follow-up engagement (possibly aided by offers like post-purchase coupons – since 82% of consumers are more likely to buy again when offered a post-purchase incentive _agilitypr.com_ _agilitypr.com_).
* **KR4: Reduced Support Contacts –** **Decrease post-purchase support contacts by 20%** (relative to order volume), through informative communications and self-service. This includes fewer “status update” calls (addressed in Theme 1) *and* fewer “how do I…?” inquiries after delivery because communications already answered them. For example, if we send a setup guide or FAQ for a product, the customer won’t need to call for help. A drop in repetitive queries indicates our communications were clear and preemptive.
* **KR5: Customer Feedback & Advocacy –** **Increase feedback loop engagement**: e.g. **NPS/CSAT survey response rate to ≥30%** (up from X%), and gather at least **Z new product reviews per month** via post-purchase prompts. Additionally, aim for a measurable uptick in positive social media mentions or referrals that cite good service/communication. This shows that customers not only receive our messages but feel positively enough to respond and advocate.

**## Key Initiatives for Proactive Communication & Engagement**
To hit these results, Walmart Canada should implement the following initiatives that leverage **automation, AI, and personalization** to create a cohesive, customer-centric communication ecosystem:
1. **Unified Communication Platform:** Deploy a **centralized customer communication system** that orchestrates all transactional messages (email, SMS, push) with consistency. This platform should ensure every trigger (order placed, item shipped, out for delivery, delivered, return received, refund issued, etc.) results in a well-timed message with a cohesive Walmart voice and branding. By unifying this, we avoid fragmented messaging. The platform will also manage customer preferences (e.g. some may opt for SMS for delivery but email for receipts). A unified system allows easy tracking of what the customer has been told and avoids either gaps or redundant messages – fostering clarity and professionalism.
2. **Personalized Email & Notification Content:** Move beyond generic messages to **personalize content at scale**. All communications should use the customer’s name and reference their specific purchase details (item name, etc.). Moreover, use **dynamic content** to include relevant product recommendations or content. For example, the delivery confirmation email might say “We hope you enjoy your new Samsung TV! You might also like these soundbars for a better experience.” or “Here are tips to get started with your new blender.” This leverages purchase data to make the communication more useful and engaging, rather than a dull status update. Given that 75% of consumers expect personalized suggestions from retailers _agilitypr.com_ _agilitypr.com_, this will meet their expectations. Ensure however that the primary info (order status) remains clear and upfront, with personalization as a value-add.
3. **Generative AI for Content and Subject Lines:** Use **Generative AI** to assist in writing compelling, human-like subject lines and message text for certain communications. For instance, instead of a bland “Your order has shipped”, an AI-generated subject could be “Great news – your order is on its way to you!”. AI can also localize and tweak tone for different customer segments (more formal vs. playful, etc., according to Walmart’s brand guidelines). We should A/B test AI-generated copy vs. human copy to optimize open and click rates. The goal is to increase the likelihood that customers will actually read the updates. However, all AI-generated content should be reviewed for accuracy (especially any details like dates or items) to ensure no hallucinations or errors – the trustworthiness of info is paramount.
4. **Multi-Channel Outreach & Opt-In:** Ensure Walmart Canada engages customers on **their preferred channels**. Right after order placement, present an option: “Get updates by SMS/push.” Make opting in easy (one tap in app or reply “YES” to a short code). Many customers appreciate SMS for urgent updates (like delivery arriving). Use **rich push notifications** in the Walmart app – these can include images (e.g. product photo or a map thumbnail when out for delivery) and action buttons (e.g. “Track now” link to app). Likewise, consider using emerging channels like **WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger** for those who opt in, as part of modern engagement. The key is to be ubiquitous but not spammy: respect opt-outs and frequency. The initiative here is to expand our reach (increase opt-in by highlighting the benefits: “never miss an update on your order”).
5. **Two-Way Messaging and Conversational Support:** Move from one-way notifications to **interactive conversations** where possible. For example, if we send an SMS that a delivery was made, allow the customer to reply “NOT RECEIVED” if they didn’t get it – which triggers an automated workflow or alerts an agent. In email, include a clearly visible help link or chatbot entry point (“Have a question? Chat now.”). On the app, every notification can deep-link to either the order page or a chat with an AI assistant. This way, if the customer has any concern, they can seamlessly transition from notification to resolution. This approach uses **conversational UX** to handle the *“long tail”* of questions customers might have post-purchase, without them having to navigate a phone menu or separate support process. It’s all integrated: the message that something shipped can be replied to with “wait, I need to change the address!” and the system can respond accordingly (perhaps handing off to an agent if needed).
6. **Post-Purchase Loyalty Offers:** Leverage the post-purchase moment to deepen customer loyalty. After a successful delivery, consider sending a **“thank you” coupon** good for a discount on the next purchase, or an invitation to join the Walmart loyalty program for additional benefits. Since **82% of consumers are highly incentivized to buy again when offered post-purchase discounts or loyalty rewards ****_agilitypr.com_**** ****_agilitypr.com_**, this can directly boost repeat sales. For example, “Thank you for your order! Here’s 10% off your next Walmart.ca purchase as a token of our appreciation.” This not only encourages another purchase, but also makes the customer feel valued beyond the transaction. (This should be targeted appropriately to avoid over-discounting; e.g. first-time customers or those we want to win back).
7. **Feedback Surveys & NPS Collection:** Incorporate **automated feedback requests** at key points. For instance, send a brief **NPS survey email** a week after delivery: “How likely are you to recommend Walmart.ca to friends?” with a 0-10 scale and an optional comment. Or a specific CSAT survey after a return is processed asking about that experience. Make surveys short and easy (one-click for rating, with a link to add comments) _wismolabs.com_ _wismolabs.com_. WISMOlabs data suggests post-purchase is an excellent time to gather feedback while the experience is fresh _wismolabs.com_. The initiative is to set up a **closed-loop feedback system**: collect feedback, analyze it (using text analytics AI on comments to flag common issues or praise), and dashboard it for product teams. Also, crucially, follow up on detractors’ feedback – if someone gives a very low score and a bad comment, that could trigger a personal outreach to remedy the situation (turning around unhappy customers shows we listen and care). Over time, this will help measure the impact of our improvements on NPS.
8. **Interactive Order Confirmation (Action Hub):** Revamp the standard order confirmation page/email into a more **interactive hub**. Right after purchase, instead of a static “Thank you” page, provide options like “Add to calendar” (for delivery estimate), “Track order” (once available), “Explore related products”, or “Contact us”. An order confirmation email could include a **“View Order Status” button** and even a summary of what to expect next (e.g. “We’ll notify you when it ships. In the meantime, check out how to assemble your new desk.”). Setting expectations and offering helpful content immediately keeps customers engaged and informed from the start. It’s a chance to reinforce that Walmart is on top of their order.
9. **Content Marketing in Post-Purchase Comms:** Blend helpful **content marketing** into post-purchase engagement. For example, after a customer buys a set of workout equipment, send a follow-up email with **health & fitness tips or a link to a relevant blog post or community forum**, along with a gentle nudge to shop related accessories. The idea is to **engage customers beyond the transaction** by providing value-added content. This can increase brand affinity (customer sees Walmart as a partner in their lifestyle or project, not just a seller). Generative AI can help tailor some of this content automatically (e.g. summarizing a longer article into a few tips in an email). Such communication should be segmented (not every customer gets generic content, but relevant to what they bought or their profile).
10. **Language and Accessibility Personalization:** Ensure communications are in the **customer’s preferred language**(English/French in Canada). The system can remember the language preference from the website session or profile. Use AI translation services to maintain quality if needed. Also, design emails and messages with accessibility in mind (simple layouts, alt text on images, compatible with screen readers). These details show respect for all customers. A visually impaired customer who receives a well-structured email that their screen reader easily reads will feel that Walmart Canada values inclusivity – an empathic touch that strengthens trust.
11. **Social Media and Community Engagement:** Extend post-purchase engagement to **social channels** and community-building. For instance, invite customers via email to share their purchase on social media (“Share your new look with #WalmartFinds for a chance to be featured”). Or direct them to Walmart’s online community or forums (if available) for tips on using their product. While optional, this can turn enthusiastic customers into brand advocates, creating a virtuous cycle of engagement. Monitoring social media for any mentions of post-purchase issues (as WISMOlabs suggests _wismolabs.com_) is also important – the comms team can proactively reach out if someone tweets “@WalmartCanada my order is late” to assist. This kind of responsive engagement in public forums further boosts trust and shows modern, omnichannel customer care.
12. **Continuous Improvement via A/B Testing:** Finally, institute a practice of **A/B testing and iterating** on all communications. Test different send times (maybe sending delivery notifications at a time when users are most likely to check their phones), different wording (does a friendly tone vs. formal tone yield higher satisfaction?), and different channels. Use metrics like open rate, click rate, conversion (if any CTA), and survey feedback to identify what works best. For example, we might find push notifications for delivered packages have higher visibility than emails – leading us to focus more on push. Or that adding a first-name personalization in subject lines increases open rates by 10%. This data-driven tweaking ensures our engagement approach stays optimized and customer-centric. It also demonstrates operational excellence in marketing communications – constantly learning from customer behavior to deliver value.

Collectively, these initiatives for **Theme 3** will ensure that Walmart Canada maintains a **helpful dialogue with customers after purchase**, rather than a monologue or, worse, silence. By proactively providing information (so customers don’t have to chase it) and by personalizing interactions (so customers feel recognized), Walmart cultivates an ongoing relationship. The result is higher customer confidence and a sense that *“Walmart cares about me even after they have my money.”* This feeling translates to stronger loyalty and positive sentiment – driving up NPS and repeat sales. As one industry expert noted, *“an optimized post-purchase experience is essentially a loyalty engine that feeds retention and leads to higher NPS”* _linkedin.com_. Theme 3’s focus on communication and engagement is a critical component of that loyalty engine.

**## Conclusion**
Walmart Canada’s digital post-purchase experience should be treated as a strategic **loyalty driver and trust builder**, not just an operational afterthought. By executing on the OKRs and initiatives across the three themes – **Transparent Tracking**, **Seamless Returns**, and **Proactive Engagement** – Walmart Canada can significantly elevate its customer experience. The benefits will be measurable: higher NPS scores (indicating more promoters and fewer detractors), increased customer lifetime value through repeat purchases, and greater operational efficiency (thanks to automation and self-service reducing manual workload). Just as importantly, customers will feel a stronger emotional connection and trust in the Walmart brand, knowing that their needs **after** clicking “Buy” are understood and met with empathy and clarity.
This strategic OKR framework emphasizes **customer-centric design**, backed by modern technology like generative AI and personalized automation, to deliver *measurable value*. Each initiative is geared toward either removing friction, adding delight, or both. For internal teams, these OKRs provide clear targets (from reducing WISMO calls to speeding up refunds) that align directly with improving customer sentiment (NPS/trust) and operational soundness.
By regularly reviewing progress on these KRs and iterating on the initiatives, Walmart Canada’s product management team can ensure the post-purchase journey remains a source of competitive advantage. In a retail landscape where consumers have many choices, excelling in the post-purchase phase – turning customers into loyal advocates – will help Walmart Canada **differentiate itself through service excellence**. As the data shows, investing in post-purchase experience is not just about avoiding problems; it’s about actively **cultivating loyalty and driving growth** _linkedin.com_ _linkedin.com_. This internal strategy will guide Walmart Canada in making every digital post-purchase interaction count – ultimately translating into happier customers, a stronger brand, and a healthier bottom line.
