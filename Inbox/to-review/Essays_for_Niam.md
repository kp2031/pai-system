1. **Personal Values:** My parents instilled in me early the values of hard work, humility, and respect, from their own upbringing in India to our home in Canada. As immigrants, they faced many struggles, but they faced them with grace and fortitude. They believed that no job was too small and no goal too big if approached with dedication and integrity. I saw my father work tirelessly, using his masters in engineering to educate young minds as a professor. My mother, managing to raise us and work part-time, taught me that you could create balance in your life. I grew to understand that values are not merely what we profess but what we demonstrate through our actions. 

2. **Self-Identity and Confidence:** As an Indian growing up in a predominantly white Canadian town, finding my identity was a complex process. I realized that my uniqueness lay in my diverse background. I embraced my Indian heritage and Canadian upbringing, learning to appreciate the convergence of these two cultures in my identity. My passion for technology and user experience helped me to find my niche, allowing me to express myself and gain confidence in my abilities. I learned to love the person I've become and to be proud of my heritage, my work, and my passions.

3. **Education and Lifelong Learning:** My father, an educator, fostered in me a profound respect for learning, not just within the confines of a classroom but as a lifelong pursuit. He emphasized that knowledge wasn't just about earning degrees, but about understanding the world better. As an industrial engineer, I embraced this love for learning, continually seeking to improve my knowledge and understanding. This journey of education is not just about professional development; it's also about personal growth and enriching your perspective.

4. **Friendship and Relationships:** My parents, with their liberal values, taught me to approach relationships with openness, understanding, and deep commitment. They encouraged me to form bonds that were not just based on shared backgrounds or interests, but also on shared values and mutual respect. In both personal and professional settings, I learned that relationships should be a two-way street – you get what you give. These principles have helped me in forming deep, committed relationships throughout my life.

5. **Dealing with Failure and Adversity:** I saw my parents face adversity with resilience, something they brought with them from their immigrant journey. They showed me that failure was not the end, but an opportunity to learn, adapt, and grow stronger. As an engineer, I encountered my share of challenges, but remembering my parents' strength, I tackled them head-on. Learning from my failures has been instrumental in my journey, providing me valuable lessons in resilience and adaptability.

6. **Career and Work-Life Balance:** Watching my father excel in his career while being present for us inspired me to strive for the same balance in my life. My love for technology and user experience pushed me to work hard in my career as an industrial engineer. At the same time, I understood the importance of not losing sight of personal relationships and self-care. It's been a learning process to juggle my commitment to my work with my commitment to my loved ones and myself.

7. **Health and Wellbeing:** My parents always stressed the importance of a balanced lifestyle for our physical and mental health. My father's disciplined lifestyle and my mother's nutritious home-cooked meals set the foundation for me. As I navigated through my career, I understood that maintaining good health wasn't just about physical fitness but also about mental wellbeing. I learned to take breaks, meditate, and maintain a positive outlook, which significantly impacted my productivity and creativity.

8. **Civic Responsibility:** My parents taught me

 the value of giving back to the community that has given us so much. They showed me that a good citizen does not just abide by the rules but takes an active role in making their community better. I have tried to carry forward this lesson by volunteering, participating in local governance, and working to make a difference. In my opinion, we all have a role to play in the improvement of our society.

9. **Financial Responsibility:** Despite their humble beginnings, my parents adeptly managed their finances, prioritizing needs over wants, and saving for the future. They taught me the importance of financial responsibility, which has guided me in my decisions as an adult. Whether it was buying my first car or investing in a start-up, the principles of financial responsibility have served me well.

10. **Understanding and Respecting Differences:** Being part of a minority in a predominantly white town made me realize the importance of understanding and respecting differences early on. My parents' liberal values taught me to appreciate diversity and learn from different cultures, beliefs, and perspectives. In my professional sphere, this understanding helped me to build a more inclusive and creative team, fostering innovative solutions.
