# PRD amendment for Monetization

I love this, can we keep building on top of this? Can we discuss how I can monetize this app? I'd love your ideas. What I was thinking we would have to add to this PRD (please let me know your thoughts on the best practices on adding new features to keep the PRD updated) - something like 3 welcome screens and a clear value proposition on the third screen about saving your speaking style and preferences so that the next time we rehearse, "your voice" is understood by us to help you faster and faster with time. from a monetization perspective, I'd like to consider all options for apps like this. I was thinking something simple like, first event and 10 rehearsals are free, if you get the benefit of the app, you can pay 99c per month for unlimited events and rehearsals with an Achiever plan and the Winner plan is if you want 1-1 Personalized Coaching that's been tuned in Canada and the US by professionals and public speakers, it's $9.99 per month and it includes access to our private community and downloadable resources and files that costs $9.99 per month, and that includes daily tips on improving speaking in small, medium and large group settings, speaking at conferences, giving speeches and much more.
