# Strategy vs. Planning: A Guide for Product Managers

Strategy vs. Planning: A Guide for Product Managers

*Based on Roger Martin’s “A Plan Is Not a Strategy”*

## The Big Idea: Plans Are Not Strategies

**What Most Companies Do Wrong**  
Most companies create detailed plans—lists of projects, features to build, metrics to hit—and call it “strategy.” But these are just to-do lists. A plan tells you *what* you’ll do. A strategy explains *why you’ll win*.

Think of it this way:

- **Planning** = “We’ll improve our app’s user experience and add 10 new features”
- **Strategy** = “We’ll win younger users by being the only app that works offline, because they have unreliable data connections”

## What Real Strategy Looks Like

A true strategy answers three questions:

1. **Where will we compete?** (Which customers, which problems)
1. **How will we win?** (Why customers will choose us)
1. **What do we need to succeed?** (Capabilities and systems)

### The Southwest Airlines Example

While other airlines were planning (adding routes, buying planes), Southwest had a strategy:

- **Where:** Short routes between secondary cities
- **How to win:** Be cheaper and more convenient than driving or taking the bus
- **What they needed:** One plane type (saves costs), no frills service, quick turnarounds

Result: They dominated their chosen market while others struggled.

## Why We Default to Planning Instead of Strategy

**Planning feels safe** because you control it:

- ✓ You can decide to build Feature X
- ✓ You can hire 5 engineers
- ✓ You can launch on a specific date

**Strategy feels scary** because you can’t control it:

- ✗ You can’t control if customers will love it
- ✗ You can’t control what competitors do
- ✗ You can’t guarantee market success

Most people choose the comfortable path (planning) over the uncertain one (strategy). But only strategy leads to winning products.

## How to Build Product Strategy (Not Just a Roadmap)

### Step 1: Pick Your Battle

Be specific about WHO you’re building for and WHAT problem you’re solving.

❌ Vague: “We’re building for small businesses”  
✅ Specific: “We’re building for freelance designers who struggle with client invoicing”

### Step 2: Define Your Win Condition

Explain why customers will choose you over alternatives (including doing nothing).

❌ Feature-focused: “We have the best invoicing features”  
✅ Strategy-focused: “Designers will choose us because we’re the only tool that connects design files directly to invoices, saving them 5 hours per week”

### Step 3: List What You Need

What capabilities must you build? What systems must work?

Example for our invoicing tool:

- Integration with design tools (Figma, Adobe)
- Automatic time tracking
- Simple UI that designers love

### Step 4: Write Your Strategy Simply

If you can’t explain your strategy in one page, it’s too complicated. Include:

- Target customer
- Their main problem
- Your unique solution
- Why you’ll win
- Key assumptions to test

### Step 5: Test and Learn

Write down what must be true for your strategy to work, then validate:

- “Designers must spend 5+ hours on invoicing” → Survey them
- “They must use Figma regularly” → Check usage data
- “They’re willing to pay $20/month” → Test pricing

## Practical Exercises for Junior PMs

### Exercise 1: Spot the Difference

Look at your current roadmap. For each item, ask:

- Is this a **plan** (what we’ll build)?
- Or does it support a **strategy** (why we’ll win)?

### Exercise 2: The One-Page Test

Try writing your product strategy in one page:

1. **We compete in:** [specific market/customer segment]
1. **We win because:** [unique value proposition]
1. **This works if:** [key assumptions]
1. **We need:** [required capabilities]
1. **We’ll know we’re winning when:** [success metrics]

### Exercise 3: The Uncomfortable Question

Ask yourself: “If our strategy fails, what’s the most likely reason?”

- If you can’t answer, you don’t have a strategy
- If the answer is “we didn’t execute well,” that’s planning thinking
- If the answer is “customers didn’t value X as much as we thought,” that’s strategic thinking

## Red Flags You’re Planning, Not Strategizing

Watch for these warning signs:

- Your “strategy” is a list of initiatives
- You focus on what you’ll build, not why customers will care
- Your roadmap could apply to any competitor
- You avoid making hard choices about what NOT to do
- Success metrics are all about shipping, not winning

## Remember This

**Planning asks:** What will we do?  
**Strategy asks:** How will we win?

As a junior PM, push yourself to think strategically:

- Don’t just list features → Explain why they’ll make you win
- Don’t just track velocity → Measure if customers are choosing you
- Don’t just copy competitors → Find your unique angle
- Don’t just solve problems → Solve them better than anyone else for a specific group

**The Ultimate Test:** Can you explain in one sentence why a customer would be foolish to choose a competitor over your product? If yes, you have a strategy. If no, you just have a plan.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
