# Prompt

I'm obsessed with how Alex Hormozi systematizes and scales businesses - his operational frameworks are next level. I want to reverse-engineer his scaling methodology for my company which has an app that can help people prepare and rehearse for a short, less than 10 min public speaking opportunity by allowing them to write out their speaking and then record themselves rehearsing and to provide feedback on what they said vs what they wanted to say. The goal is to help people be better offline through rehearsal. And the person that uses the app will get more applauses. What are the key systems, metrics, and processes I need to implement to scale from my current level to $10M+ revenue? I need a complete systematization roadmap with KPls, team structure recommendations, and a 24-month scaling timeline. Goal is to build a business that runs withoughme while growing 300% year-over-year.
