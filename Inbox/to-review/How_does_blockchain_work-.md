# How does blockchain work?

**_How does blockchain work?_**

Blockchain technology allows people to transfer information and assets over the Internet without any intermediaries such as banks or brokerage firms. The following graphic illustrates how a blockchain transaction works.

A transaction is requested (for example, a digital currency transfer)

The request is sent to a peer-to-peer network made up of computers, which are called nodes

The network of nodes validates the transaction

The transaction is then combined with other transactions to create a new block of data that is stored in a digital ledger using cryptography

The new block is added to the existing blockchain. Each block references the block before it, creating a permanent and unalterable record

The transaction is complete
