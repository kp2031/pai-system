# Care 5-page exec summary

I need to make a 5 slide executive summary for my “care” Portfolio in product management (which consists of the help centre on Walmart.ca, the chatbot, the agent chat, the voicebot, the contact centre human agent voice system, the contact centre human agent enablement tools and the human agent operational systems that our Walmart care ops teams use to manage contacts). 

The executive were giving an update to leads both the ops side of “care” as well as the product management side of “care”.

He wants to know more about our product strategy and roadmap.

So I’d like to structure the slides with a (1) look back on Annual Operating Plan (AOP) process and budgeting, (2) update on what was approved to be “above the line” based on the limited budget we received, (3) what we launched in Q1 as well as work we started in Q1 for a Q2/Q3 launch, (4) what we have learnt in the past quarter to inform changes to direction in Q2, and what insights we’ve uncovered to change our H2 plans as well as our AOP priorities for next year (more chat experience and ai chat focus).

To make your executive summary slides as impactful and clear as possible, could you please share:
	1.	Your top 2–3 strategic themes or pillars from the AOP (e.g. reduce contact rate, improve CSAT, increase self-service rate)?

Reduce contact rate, chatbot usage, chatbot satisfaction, reduce average handling time, increase first contact resolution.

	2.	A quick summary of what was actually approved in the budget (e.g. chatbot AI improvements, voicebot maintenance only, etc.)?

Unifying incident management into one platform, voicebot ramp up in both contact centres, standing up of the cca2 global leveraged platform, building guided workflows in cca2 for WISMO and wismr (where is my order and where is my refund)

	3.	Key Q1 launches (e.g. redesigned help centre, new agent tool release, etc.) and which items started in Q1 targeting Q2/Q3 delivery?

Q1 highlights - launched unified incident management platform, and standing up of the cca2 global leveraged platform

	4.	Top 2–3 insights or learnings from Q1 (e.g. low bot deflection rate in certain intents, high CSAT for human agents, etc.)?

Gaps in chat experience (transcript not automatically being transferred from oracle chat system to Walmart built incident management system, gaps in customer experience with our chatbot timing out or refreshing when customers left the page and then had to rejoin the wait / queue, customers having to repeat themselves after going through voicebot since the transcript didn’t transfer to incident management for a human agent to read before helping the customer.

	5.	Any major directional shifts for H2 or next year you already foresee (e.g. investing more in chat/AI, less in voice, etc.)? 

Focus on closing chat issues, understand gen ai components of chat we can test from the US team in the future, less voicebot focus, invest more in customer experience gaps in chat, ask for a Ux study on chat to do an end to end analysis and insights deep dive 

Your help and guidance is much appreciated - and if there are things I’ve left out, please share some guidance on how to best think about this space as I’m new to it and how I can incorporate into my executive update.
