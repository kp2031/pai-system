# Testing multiple system - Lovable, Cursor, ChatGPT Codex.

I'm a super beginner at coding but have a pretty complex setup because i want to learn how all of these tools can work together for me.

So I'd like you to walk me through step by step some of the best practices for creating a website that allows customers to sign up for a free account with their email address. The email gets verified with a one time password (recommend 3 of the top services that do this) and then once they're logged in, they can upload several powerpoint presentations (in a super secure way that is fully encrypted like a bank, recommend the top 3 services that allow you to do this) and each one shows up as a thumbnail, and then they can select as many as you want and it creates a new powerpoint with all of the slides from the selected powerpoint files.

what i want you to do is walk me through how i can use lovable ai to create the ui of the site, how i can upload it to my github, and also connect it to a supabase for a secure login. And then i want you to share how i can finish in lovable, make sure my github is working. then go into cursor and connect it to that project in github, and then flesh out the functionality of the uploading of ppt files and them showing up in a gallary. and then after cursor does some magic and writes all the code, for me to upload all that code to my github (i'm not sure if i'm using the right words, since all i know is github is where you upload and download code to - please help me use all of these the right way).

And then after uploading all my cursor code to my github - I'd like a step by step guide how i can open up my github project in my ChatGPT teams account that has access to the new Codex agents, released in may 2025. so i can use multiple agents to build capabilities for my site, like the ability for someone to flip through the slides within a deck but while it's still showing the thumbnails of each slide, so i know if that's the right deck. so making small tweaks to my master code using codex the right way with the latest may 2025 best practices.

and your step by step guide about what i do after i've done some work in chatgpt codex - and how i can go back to cursor to do some more coding on my app.

and then uploading that to github.

and then step by step how i open it up again in Lovable to make weaks to the colours of the website.

This would be amazing!
