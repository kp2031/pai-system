# Prompt to ChatGPT Agent to go do some comp analysis

Hi there, for some personal context to help you guide me: i'm a first time, solo founder / entrepreneur (no sales yet, so not sure i can call myself this) at the moment, not by choice, but just trying to get started. all i've done is register myself for a sole proprietor business with the canadian / ontario government, got a business and hst numbers so i can upload my app to the apple app store. i have an apple developer account basically populated and ready to upload my app. I have the following domains registered so far: bebetteroffline.com (for the main hub) and rehearsmart.com (for the first app). I have a Google Workspace Business Plus account with access to all of the services this provides and would like to maximize these in as simple and practical way as possible - but currently only need this for a professional email with my domain hello@bebetteroffline.com it's the only email I have for the business at the moment, to keep everything simple for now. and from a technical perspective, i have both my sites built with vercel and the code being managed via my github. i work on the code using an ai coding agent because i don't know how to code or anything about coding other than i need a github for version control and as a way to revert if necessary. i've been playing around with various coding agents, and am indifferent at the moment. don't hesitate to ask me follow-up questions after you've done bulding out all of these files so i can answer and we can keep going deeper. 

for some "business context": so we at Be Better Offline have a strategic plan, attached pdf, and we've been working on creating an app called RehearSmart (PRD2.md attached is a refreshed version of our PRD document and it highlights where we're at with building the app today) as one of many apps that help people be better offline. The next_steps_brainstorming.md file attached is some initial brainstorming I've done about how we can proceed forward. I would like you to read through these documents and share what I should add to this and what I could remove as well. I also need you to go online and do a full and deep competitive analysis and current state analysis (create a competitive_analysis_sept_8_2025.docx file with all of this info) on who's out there doing what i want to do with both Be Better Offline - from books, to podcasts, to youtube channels, to x accounts, to instagram and tiktok, to community building websites, to computer apps, mobile apps, web apps, watch apps, tablet apps, and anything else you gather from a competition trying to get the attention of people in the same themes that Be Better Offline is trying for. don't hesitate to ask me follow-up questions after you've done bulding out all of these files so i can answer and we can keep going deeper. 

After you've created this document (competitive_analysis_sept_8_2025.docx), can you create a document 30_60_90_day_plan_sept_8_2025.docx that outlines the most efficient and effective way to proceed. There are many prominient attention acquisition leaders in this entrepreneurial space like Alex Hormozi, Codie Sanchez & Daniel Priestley. there are many prominient influencers in the start up journey space that bring on guests that have done what i've done and so they've shared their best practices about how to start a startup in many videos on youtube like Greg Isenberg's youtube channel and starter story youtube channel. please do a deep dive, synthesize what you're getting and be as simple as possible. don't hesitate to ask me follow-up questions after you've done bulding out all of these files so i can answer and we can keep going deeper. 

If you also want to create a follow_up_questions_sept_8_2025.docx file with all of your follow-up questions that i can answer and give back to you, i can do that.
