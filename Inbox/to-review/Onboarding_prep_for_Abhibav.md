# Onboarding prep for Abhibav

You are a world-class executive coach and product operations strategist specializing in onboarding senior product managers within large-scale enterprise organizations. You deeply understand the nuances of stakeholder alignment, platform ownership, and customer service product innovation in complex matrixed organizations such as Fortune 100 retailers.

I would like you to generate a **very detailed and professional one-page 30-60-90 day onboarding and execution plan** for a new **Senior Manager of Product Management** named **Abhinav**, who starts today.

Abhinav is joining the **Digital Experience Technology organization** at a major retailer (think Walmart scale) and will **lead two direct reports**, each owning distinct areas of the business. His success will be measured by his ability to drive product excellence, stakeholder confidence, roadmap clarity, user-centered improvements, platform scalability, and cross-functional execution.

### Organizational Context:
- Abhinav will report into a Director who oversees ~40 people across digital experience transformation, analytics, testing, and platform strategy.
- The team is undergoing a transition, merging business-led product functions with technology teams under one unified structure.
- Abhinav’s role spans both strategic oversight and tactical product leadership.
- The next 30 days are critical for establishing his credibility, understanding systems and teams, and identifying major friction points or quick wins.

### Abhinav’s Direct Areas of Product Responsibility (Split Between Two Team Members):
#### **POX (Post-Order Experience):**
1. Help Centre platform (support content, self-serve UX)
2. Comms (email/SMS/notifications around orders)
3. Tracking (order status pages, delivery maps)
4. Customer Order Management Tools (cancel, reschedule, refund, return flows)

#### **Care (Customer Support Experience):**
1. Chat/Bot (front-end chat experiences including NLP and handoff)
2. Voice/Bot/IVR (voice UX, telephony integration, conversational AI)
3. Agent Tools (tools used by customer support agents for managing cases)

### Desired Output:
Please provide a clear, structured **30-60-90 day onboarding and execution plan** for Abhinav, in **one page**, ideally divided into:
- Key Objectives per 30-day period
- Recommended Activities & Focus Areas
- Expected Deliverables
- Stakeholders to Engage
- Potential Watchouts
- Metrics of Early Success

### Key Expectations:
- Emphasize user-centric platform thinking, data-driven decision-making, team empowerment, stakeholder alignment, and an experimentation mindset.
- Embed best practices from product management, agile team leadership, and enterprise onboarding.
- Balance technical understanding with business value creation.
- Include the need to meet cross-functional teams such as engineering, CX ops, customer support, analytics, UX, and international stakeholders.
- Ensure it includes sections to assess the current state of platforms, workflows, KPIs, team skills, and delivery bottlenecks.

The output should be **tight and executive-ready** — it should feel like something I can hand to Abhinav directly as a living guide for his first 90 days. Keep it sharp, structured, and grounded in practical execution.

Some specific initiatives that are currently live: 
Migrating to cca 2.0 for the help pillar, launching voice bots, new Ux for the help centre, deep dives on plugging holes in the contact center escalation process, preparing for an executive presentation in July at the CEO level, at a meeting called MSM and a series of deep dives with our chief growth officer, Joseph. and for the second pillar, post order experience ( POX ), there are improvements to the order delay experience, there is a user research deep dive on all of the transactional communications that Canada send out to customers, there are also several bugs related to communications that have been escalated by Joseph, the chief growth officer that we are tracking to have fixed, there is a special deep dive project with our customer insights team that is related to increasing the number of responses we get to our survey request via email.
