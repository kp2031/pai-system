**Connecting an Echelon Bike to Zwift:**
Using a spin bike on Zwift has a number of benefits including structured training, social community, and connection to 3rd party apps like Strava, Garmin, TrainingPeaks, MapMyRide, etc. 
To connect an Echelon Exercise Bike to Zwift, you will need the following:
* Echelon Connect Bike (EX-1LE, EX-3, EX-5, EX-5S, Connect Sport, Connect Prime)
* iOS or Android Device Running qDomyos-Zwift App
* Separate Device (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, or AppleTV) Running Zwift – **Note, this must be a separate device from the device running the qDomyos-Zwift app. Check Zwift.com for minimum system requirements.**

* Ensure your bike is plugged in. Pedal a bit to “wake up” your bike. 
* On iOS/Android device open the qDomyos-Zwift App. It should automatically detect and connect to your bike and begin displaying metrics.
* Connect Heart Rate Monitor to qDomyos-Zwift App:
	1.  Apple Watch – Ensure qDomyos-Zwift Watch App is running – it may take up to 1 min for the watch app to begin displaying heart rate.
	2. Other Heart Rate Monitor – **it may take up to 30 second to connect to the HRM**

* On a separate device open Zwift. Log in.
* When you reach the device pairing screen:
	1. First Pair Power Source – Selecting the iOS/Android Device running qDomyos-Zwift App
	2. Second Pair Cadence Source – Selecting the iOS/Android Device running qDomyos-Zwift App
	3. Third Pair Heart Rate Source – Selecting the iOS/Android Device.

From this point, you should be ready to get Zwifting.  If you experience issues connecting devices, please check/try the following:
* Confirm that qDomyos-Zwift App and Zwift are running on separate devices.
* Try closing all apps on both devices and starting again fresh.
* Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the device that is running Zwift app. To resolve BLE Pairing Issues on a MacBook visit this helpful page: Zwift Support: MAC BLE Pairing Issues

* Ensure that Cadence Sensor (Peloton Compatibility) Setting is toggled off in qDomyos-Zwift App. Remember when you change a setting you need to close the app and reopen the app.
* Try unplugging your bike for 10 seconds and plugging it back in. 

**Using the qDomyos – Zwift App with Echelon Bike & Peloton Digital App**
**Two Device Solution for iOS:**

For this solution, you will need the following:
* Echelon Connect Bike (EX-1LE, EX-3, EX-5, EX-5S, Connect Sport, Connect Prime)
* iOS Device Running qDomyos-Zwift App
* *Optional: *Heart Rate Monitor or Apple Watch – If you want to use your Apple Watch as a Heart Rate monitor then you will need to run the qDomyos-Zwift App on the iPhone that is paired with your Apple Watch
* iOS/iPadOS Device Running Peloton Digital App

Peloton Digital App on iOS/iPadOS is capable of displaying cadence and heart rate from an external sensor, which is how it will see qDomyos-Zwift App. This is not possible on other OS (Android, AppleTV, FireStick, etc.) or in the browser-based version of Peloton workouts. This may be desirable because using this information, the Peloton Digital App will record your Cadence and Heart Rate performance within the “Workouts” section of your profile.  However, it will not record things like distance or output.  
To display Cadence and Heart Rate in Peloton Digital App on iOS follow these steps:
1. Ensure your bike is plugged in. Pedal a bit to “wake up” your bike. 
2. On iOS device open the qDomyos-Zwift App. It should automatically detect and connect to your bike and begin displaying metrics.
3. Connect Heart Rate Monitor to qDomyos-Zwift App:
	1.  Apple Watch:
		1. Launch qDomyos-Zwift App on Apple Watch. If it is not installed you may need to go into the Apple Watch App on your paired iPhone and install the qDomyos-Zwift App onto your Apple Watch
		2. Press (Long) Start on qDomyos-Zwift App on Apple Watch. Confirm Heart Rate is displayed on qDomyos-Zwift App on Apple Watch and on iPhone
	2. Other Heart Rate Monitor – no actions are required from the user
4. On second iOS/iPadOS device open Peloton Digital App
5. Select your workout and begin workout
6. Tapping on the screen will bring up a series of icons on the right hand side of the screen as seen below:

![Qdomyos-2](images/Qdomyos-2.jpeg)

1. Tap on the sensor icon indicated in the image above. Which will display the following “Connected Devices” selection box:

![Qdomyos-3](images/Qdomyos-3.png)

1. Tap on either Heart Rate or Cadence.
2. The next screen should show you the name of the device that is running the qDomyos-Zwift App. For example “John’s iPhone”. Select your device. 
3. To add the other sensor display to your screen, repeat the process – tap screen, select sensors icon, tap Cadence, select your device. You should be able to see Heart Rate and Cadence within the Peloton Digital App on iOS/iPadOS:

![Qdomyos-4](images/Qdomyos-4.gif)

If you run the Peloton Digital App on an OS other than iOS/iPadOS you can simply use the qDomyos-Zwift App as your “bike computer” to track all the necessary metrics during your Peloton workout.  This allows you to use the qDomyos-Zwift App Settings to customize the tiles which are displayed including Cadence, Echelon Resistance, Peloton Resistance (automatically calculated to align with Peloton coaches instructions), Output (Watts), FTP % (Power Zone), Heart Rate, and more.
For example:

**Transferring to Data to Strava**
Another great feature of the qDomyos-Zwift App is the ability to save a workout in .GPX or .FIT format that can then be uploaded to your favorite fitness tracking service such as Strave, Garmin, MapMyFitness, etc. If your preferred service will accept .FIT files that is the preferable format.
Important: when you open the qDomyos-Zwift app, it immediately begins recording a workout session. Therefore following these steps will download a complete file from the moment you opened the app. So, if you want a “clean” file for a workout, close the app and reopen it to begin a new workout record.
The following is the process for uploading a .FIT file to Strava:
1. Immediately when you complete your workout, tap the menu button on the qDomyos-Zwift App.
2. Select Save .FIT (or .GPX if necessary). This will save a .FIT file into the qDomyos-Zwift Folder on your device. For instance, on an iPhone, look inside the Files App → Click Browse and find the qDomyos-Zwift App:

![Qdomyos-6](images/Qdomyos-6.gif)

Within that folder you can use the menu button to change the way the files are displayed and the order in which they are displayed so that the most recent file is displayed at the top.
1. Strava only allows manual file uploads through it’s website (not it’s mobile app). But, you can do this from your mobile device.
	1. Go to Strava.com

	2. Click on menu (top left) and click Log In. Logging in will likely force the mobile app to open on your phone.
	3. Switch back to your browser.
	4. Open the browser menu (3 dots at the bottom right on Chrome; Two letter A’s at the top left of Safari) and “Request the Desktop Site.
	5. Open Strava Site Menu (3 lines at top right) Scroll all the way down below your profile name and select Upload Activity.
	6. Select File from the left hand navigation menu.
	7. Select Choose File. Select Browse. This will open the File Browser App on your iPhone.
	8. Navigate to the qDomyoszwift folder on your iPhone. Select your .FIT or .GPX file. This will take you back to Strava page.
	9. Strava will process for a few seconds. Then click “Save and View” in the the lower right corner of the web page. The workout will now be on the Strava Web Site and the Strava Mobile App. From there you can edit, add comments, add photos, etc.

Note: Some metrics and graphs will only be available with Strava Subscription ~ USD $5/month.
