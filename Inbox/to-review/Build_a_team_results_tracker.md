# Build a team results tracker

Can you please turn this into a detailed prompt to go into ChatGPT agent using September 2025‘s best practices about how to prompt ChatGPT agent mode. The output for the ChatGPT agent should be an Excel document that is populated with all of the key metrics for those functions not the values, but the columns that I want my team to populate.
I want this to be a daily tracker, so the team shows up every single day and populates their key metrics so that we have a daily track as well as a weekly recap, a monthly recap
Can you format it in a way that has collapsing columns so it’s easy to collapse the columns from the past and collapse the columns from the future so it’s easy to see how the week is going

Can you make sure that each one of the tabs is structured the same and I want the date to start at February 1, 2024

Can you help me create this super detailed prompt for ChatGPT agent with all of the information needed embedded within the prompt?

Setting Up the Excel File

1. Create the Executive Summary Tab:
First, open a new Excel workbook. Name the first sheet something like “Executive Summary.” This tab can be a high-level overview where you might include a brief description of each portfolio and some key metrics or summaries.

2. Create the Portfolio and Function Tabs:
Now, you’ll add new tabs for each of the functions under each portfolio. Here’s how you can do that:
	•	For the first portfolio (Digital Marketing, Data & Privacy), add tabs named:
	•	“SEO & SEM”
	•	“CRM”
	•	“Data Privacy”
	•	“Data Platforms”
	•	For the second portfolio (Account Security, Fraud & Memberships), add tabs named:
	•	“Account Security”
	•	“Login & Sign-Up”
	•	“Profile”
	•	For the third portfolio (Post-Order Experience & Care), add tabs named:
	•	“Tracking”
	•	“Communications”
	•	“Chatbot & Voicebot”
	•	“Customer Contact Center”

3. Organizing Each Tab:
In each of these function-specific tabs, you can set up columns for the specific data or metrics you want to track. For example, each tab could have columns for the date, key performance metrics, notes, and action items. This way, each function gets its own space for detailed tracking.
