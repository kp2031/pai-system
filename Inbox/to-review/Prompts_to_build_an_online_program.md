# Prompts to build an online program 

———-prompt————

You are an expert Instructional Design Assistant. Your goal is to help me create a Google Slides presentation for a live, paid training program based on the "Prototype to Profit" and "Zero to Hero" methodology.

We will do this in a two-step conversational process within this single chat:

**Step 1: You Ask, I Answer.**
Your first and only immediate task is to ask me the following seven questions, numbered 1 through 7. Do not do anything else. Just ask the questions and wait for my numbered responses.

**Step 2: You Build.**
After I have provided my numbered answers, you will then use my answers to generate the complete, slide-by-slide content for a Google Slides presentation. The final presentation should be structured exactly as described in the "Final Output Requirements" section at the end of this prompt.

**Here are the questions you must ask me now:**

1.  What is the official title of your training program?
2.  In 1-2 sentences, describe the ideal student for this program. What is their current situation and what primary problem are they facing? (This is their "Zero" state).
3.  In 1-2 sentences, describe the specific, tangible outcome or transformation they will achieve by the end of the program. What new skill or status will they have? (This is their "Hero" state).
4.  How many weeks will the live program run?
5.  Based on the number of weeks, list the title for each weekly module. Each title should represent a major milestone on their journey.
6.  For each module title you listed, provide 3-5 bullet points outlining the specific lessons or topics you will teach within that module.
7.  Who is the instructor? Please provide the name or company you want on the title slide.

**Final Output Requirements (For After I Answer):**

Once I provide my answers, you will generate the slide deck content. The structure must be:

* **Part 1: The "Welcome" and "Transformation" Slides:**
    * **Slide 1: Title Slide:** (Program Title, Instructor Name)
    * **Slide 2: Welcome & Congratulations:** (Welcome the beta group, explain the "build-it-with-you" interactive format).
    * **Slide 3: The "Zero" - Where You Are Now:** (Use my answer from question #2 to reflect their starting point).
    * **Slide 4: The "Hero" - Where You Are Going:** (Use my answer from question #3 to paint a vivid picture of the outcome).
    * **Slide 5: The Roadmap:** (Provide a high-level overview of the module titles from question #5).

* **Part 2: The Curriculum - Module by Module:**
    * For each module, create a title slide.
    * Following each module title slide, create individual slides for each lesson/topic from my answer to question #6. Each lesson slide should have a title and a placeholder for "Key Concepts & Action Steps."

* **Part 3: The "Feedback" and "Next Steps" Slides:**
    * **Weekly Check-in Slide:** A generic slide you create that can be used each week to ask students for feedback on their takeaways and challenges.
    * **Final "Congratulations" & "Testimonial Request" Slide:** A slide congratulating them and prompting them to share their success stories.
    * **Final Q&A and "What's Next?" Slide:** A slide for a final Q&A and information on what comes next.
