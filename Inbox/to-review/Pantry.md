# Pantry

Here are some tips and categories you can use to organize your pantry based on what I can see from the photo:
**## Categories for Organization**
1. **Grains and Pasta**: Group items like rice, quinoa, oats, and pasta together. Use clear containers to store these for easy visibility and to keep them fresh.
2. **Snacks**: Keep snacks (e.g., chips, popcorn, sweet treats) in a dedicated section. You can use bins or baskets to corral loose snack bags, which will help keep things tidy.
3. **Canned Goods**: Organize all your canned goods in one area. Consider using stackable can racks or shelves to save space and make them easily accessible.
4. **Sauces and Condiments**: Put items like sriracha, peanut butter, and pasta sauce together. You could use turntables (lazy Susans) to access them easily.
5. **Breakfast Items**: Group cereals, oats, and breakfast bars together. If space allows, use containers for bulk cereals.
6. **Baking Supplies**: Organize flour, sugar, baking powder, and other baking essentials in one section. Clear, airtight containers can be helpful here to keep them fresh.
7. **Spices and Seasonings**: Use a separate basket or spice rack for all spices and smaller seasoning jars to avoid clutter.
8. **Supplements and Health Products**: Keep vitamins, protein powders, and other supplements in one designated area.

**## Organizational Ideas**
* **Use Bins and Baskets**: For loose items like snacks, granola bars, and small packages, bins or baskets will keep them from cluttering shelves.
* **Label Containers**: Labeling bins and containers can help you know exactly what’s inside without having to open them.
* **Vertical Space**: Utilize shelf risers or stackable bins to make better use of the vertical space on your shelves.
* **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**: Organize your items so the oldest items are in the front. This helps you use them before they expire.
* **Clear Containers**: Using transparent containers for bulk items like cereals, grains, or snacks will help you easily identify what’s inside and keep your pantry looking neat.

**## Example of Shelf Breakdown (From the Image)**
* **Top Shelf**: Bulk items like rice, pasta, cereal, and paper towels. Consider using large, clear containers to store these items.
* **Second Shelf**: Snacks like crackers, Smart Sweets, and other treats. Use baskets to separate savory from sweet.
* **Middle Shelf**: Condiments and sauces (e.g., Rao’s sauces, peanut butter). Consider a turntable or narrow baskets for easier access.
* **Fourth Shelf**: Chips and baking items (flour, mixes). Group chips together in baskets and baking supplies in containers.
