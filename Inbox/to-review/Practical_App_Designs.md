Practical App Designs

---------
Legal Application
---------

The corporation intends to design, develop and deploy Apps through the mobile marketplaces of Google and Apple. The focus of the business will specifically be on practical apps, not entertainment or games. The focus on Apps is key to this engineering design company because we are producing a product to sell, not a service or consulting business. This separates Practical App Designs from other design firms.

Clientele will be customers of the Apple app stores as well as the Google app stores that are looking for practical apps they can use on their smartphone. The focused nature of the software we're selling, Practical Apps, is very specific in this industry, which tends to have more games (e.g. Angry Birds) than practical apps that are well designed.

The business is based on the three words in the name - "Practical" because we are entirely focused on utility applications that everyone can use regularly and are consumer facing. "App" is used because we are focused on building Mobile Apps or Apps for smartphones. And "Designs" because we plan to spend a lot of time designing world class apps to sell to our customers.

There are many generic engineering design firms that sell consulting services that came up in my search. None are focused on the design of practical smartphone applications. I also have registered PracticalAppDesigns.com which indicates there are no businesses with that name, otherwise the primary .com domain would not be available.
