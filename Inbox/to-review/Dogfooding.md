**The Kal Kan Anecdote — A Lesson in Authentic Confidence**

In the 1970s, **Kal Kan**, a major pet food brand in the U.S., ran a television commercial that would later become part of Silicon Valley folklore. According to industry retellings, the president of Kal Kan appeared on camera and made a simple but bold claim: *he fed his own dogs the same dog food the company sold in stores*.

This wasn’t just marketing puffery. It was a symbolic gesture — a way to communicate, without jargon, **complete belief in the product’s quality**. If the food was good enough for his own beloved pets, it must be good enough for millions of others. It cut straight through consumer skepticism, humanized the brand, and demonstrated a level of authenticity that few executives dared show.

This moment cemented the idea that **true product confidence comes from lived experience**. When leaders and creators *use what they sell*, it signals integrity. There’s no hiding behind metrics, polish, or packaging — the product must stand up to real-world use.

This story is the emotional and conceptual root of what became “dogfooding” in tech. The transition from feeding dogs to feeding internal teams is metaphorical, but the core principle is unchanged:

**If you won’t use what you build, why should anyone else?**

In 1988, Microsoft manager Paul Maritz sent an internal email titled “Eating our own Dogfood” to Brian Valentine, the test manager for Microsoft LAN Manager. In this message, Maritz challenged the team to increase internal usage of their own product. This initiative aimed to ensure that Microsoft employees experienced the software firsthand, identifying issues and improvements before releasing it to customers. The term “dogfooding” has since become a widely adopted practice in the tech industry, emphasizing the importance of using one’s own products to validate their quality and usability.   

**Why This Matters for us**

	•	It’s a **standard of credibility**: If your team is willing to build features but not live with them day-to-day, that’s a red flag. Dogfooding forces you to share the same user frustrations and joys that your customers will experience.
	•	It’s a **commitment to quality over polish**: Marketing might smooth over cracks, but internal usage exposes them fast. This creates a culture where usability and utility matter more than surface.
	•	It builds **cross-functional trust**: When engineering, design, and product all participate in dogfooding, you’re not siloed theorists — you’re co-experiencers. That aligns everyone around a shared vision grounded in reality.
	•	It reinforces **customer-centricity** from within: It turns your whole organization into a test market, helping validate whether a feature works in messy, human, real-world conditions — before exposing users to potential failure.

**Practical Applications**

	1.	**Empathy-Driven Development**: Encourage team members to use the product in real-world scenarios to better understand user experiences and challenges.
	2.	**Early Detection of Issues**: By using the product internally, teams can identify and address bugs or usability problems before they reach customers.
	3.	**Continuous Feedback Loop**: Establish channels for internal users to provide feedback, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
	4.	**Cross-Functional Involvement**: Involve various departments in using the product to gain diverse perspectives and insights. 
	5.	**Enhanced Product Quality**: Regular internal use can lead to more polished and user-friendly products, as teams are directly invested in the product’s success.

We must implement the concept of dogfooding our products, as it will lead to more robust, user-centric products and a more cohesive understanding among team members of the product’s strengths and areas for improvement.
