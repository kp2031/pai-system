# Presentation server - internal to a company 

How do you take a presentation that’s created by PowerPoint copilot and turn it into a McKenzie level presentation 

The key has to be that the service does not upload sensitive corporate data into an LLM to learn more 

It’s basically like incognito mode in ChatGPT 

So someone can generate a presentation quickly using copilot and then enhance it using an executive polish agent 

One of the capabilities of the enhancer tool could be to add graphs and charts as placeholders when it is appropriate, and then add comments so that someone can make a request to gather data off-line from someone that they could paste into the graphs back end, providing an Excel template for someone to populate off-line so that when the data is received, it can easily be pasted into the PowerPoint presentation to populate the graph
