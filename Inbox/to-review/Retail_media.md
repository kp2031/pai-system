Hereâ€™s a condensed prompt you could use in Beautiful.ai to generate a comprehensive McKinsey-style presentation on retail media growth at Amazon and Walmart, along with strategies for Target:

"Create a presentation titled 'Navigating Retail Media Growth: Strategies for Target'. Begin with an introduction slide defining retail media and its market significance. Follow with a market overview detailing the size, growth, and key players, focusing on Amazon and Walmart. Include a case study slide illustrating their successful strategies. Add a competitive analysis highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for Target. Design a strategy slide for building Target's retail media network, detailing partnership and technology investment opportunities. Conclude with an implementation roadmap outlining short-term actions and long-term strategies for Target, and a final slide summarizing key takeaways and next steps. Ensure the presentation style is professional and polished, akin to McKinsey's standards." 

This prompt guides the AI to create a structured and strategic presentation that is both insightful and visually appealing, suitable for executive-level discussions.
