# The Road To Character - by David Brooks

The Road To Character - by David Brooks

Culture of the past - encouraging people to be...
- more skeptical of their desires
- more aware of their weaknesses
- more intent on combating the flaws in their own natures
- Turning weakness into strength
- less likely to feel that every thought, feeling and achievement should be immediately shared with the world at large

Shift - from a culture of humility to a culture of the big ME 

Data -- in 1950, high school students - asked if they think they're very important 12% and in 2005 it was 80%

Humility - guards from our least attractive tendencies - prideful, self-congratulatory, hubristic
