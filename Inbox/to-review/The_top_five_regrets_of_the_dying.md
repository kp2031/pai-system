# The top five regrets of the dying

The top five regrets of the dying

I wish that I had let myself be happier
I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends
I wish I had the courage to express my feelings
I wish I hadn't worked so hard
I wish I had the courage to live a life true to myself and not the one expected of me
