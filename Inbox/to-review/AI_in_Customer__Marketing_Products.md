# AI in Customer & Marketing Products

**AI and Generative AI in Omnichannel Retail Product Management**

**Introduction**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) – including the latest generation of **Generative AI (GenAI)** – is transforming how retailers operate and serve customers across channels. In a national omnichannel retail context like **Walmart Canada**, AI-driven solutions are becoming essential for efficiency, customer satisfaction, and growth. This white paper explores AI and GenAI applications across multiple product management functions: **Digital Marketing, Post-Purchase Customer Experience, Chatbots, Voice Bots, Contact Centre operations, Omni-Channel Customer Identification, Account Security & Fraud Reduction, Membership & Loyalty Programs, and Financial Services**. For each area, we identify key use cases and how they benefit individual team members, cross-team collaboration, leadership visibility, customer insights, operational data analysis, customer-facing digital products, and internal operational tools. We also highlight specific **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** to track (e.g. conversion rate, Net Promoter Score/NPS, average handle time/AHT, fraud reduction percentage) and, where available, industry benchmark improvements. Real-world examples from leading companies (e.g. Walmart, Amazon, Loblaw, Carrefour, RBC, etc.) and technology providers (e.g. OpenAI, Google Cloud AI, Salesforce) are included to illustrate successful applications.

*AI vs. GenAI:* It is important to distinguish between general AI techniques and generative AI. **Traditional AI** in retail often involves predictive analytics and machine learning models that analyze data and automate decisions (such as predicting demand or detecting fraud). **Generative AI**, a newer subset of AI, refers to models like GPT-4 that can create new content (text, images, code, etc.) and engage in human-like conversations. Both have distinct capabilities: for example, a machine learning model might segment customers or detect anomalies, while a generative AI model could write individualized marketing copy or power a virtual shopping assistant in natural language. In the following sections, we note where generative AI specifically adds new capabilities on top of classical AI approaches. The goal is to provide business and product leaders a clear view of how these technologies can drive value in an omnichannel retail enterprise, without unnecessary jargon.

**1. Digital Marketing**

Digital Marketing is a critical function where AI and GenAI are driving substantial improvements in personalization, efficiency, and campaign performance. Modern AI tools enable **hyper-targeted customer segmentation, personalized content creation, and optimized ad spending** at a scale impossible to achieve manually. For a retailer with both e-commerce and physical stores, AI can tailor marketing messages to individual customers and adjust strategies in real-time based on data. GenAI further enhances this by generating creative content (text, images, videos) and managing conversations, allowing marketing teams to deliver more engaging and relevant campaigns. Key use cases and benefits in digital marketing include:
	•	**Personalized Promotions & Product Recommendations:** AI algorithms analyze customer behavior, purchase history, and demographics to target shoppers with the right offers at the right time. This personalization boosts conversion rates and marketing ROI. For instance, AI-driven product recommendation engines can increase sales by **10–30%** . A McKinsey study notes that overall, AI-powered personalization can raise retail revenues by around **15% while reducing marketing costs by 20%** , as campaigns become more efficient and better targeted. The benefit extends to customers in the form of more relevant deals, and to individual marketing team members by automating the heavy analytics required for micro-targeting. Leadership gains visibility through AI dashboards that show which segments respond best to which promotions, informing high-level strategy. **KPIs:** Conversion rate uplift, click-through rate (CTR), incremental sales from campaigns, and marketing spend efficiency are key to measure. **Industry benchmark:** Retailers leveraging AI personalization have seen profit increases on the order of 15%  and significant lift in customer engagement metrics.
	•	**AI-Generated Marketing Content (GenAI for Creative):** Generative AI is enabling marketing teams to rapidly produce tailored content – from ad copy and emails to images and videos. This improves **individual efficiency** (e.g. a single marketer can generate dozens of ad variants using AI) and ensures brand messaging is consistent yet personalized. For example, **Marks & Spencer** implemented an AI language generation platform (by Persado) to create personalized email campaign content, resulting in a **20% increase in email conversion rates**  . In that case, the AI analyzed customer data and crafted emotionally resonant language for each segment, lifting conversions and contributing “tens of millions in potential revenue growth” . Another example is **Amazon’s AI-powered image generation tool** for product ads: it transforms basic product photos into contextual, lifestyle images using text-to-image GenAI. Amazon reported up to a **40% higher click-through rate** on ads using these AI-generated images . These examples show how GenAI can automate creative production while improving marketing performance. **KPIs:** CTR, conversion rate, and content production turnaround time. **Technology examples:** Persado’s AI copywriting platform, OpenAI’s GPT-4 for text, or image-generation models integrated into ad platforms. Many companies (including Amazon and Meta) now embed GenAI in their marketing tools to help advertisers create more effective content.
	•	**Customer Segmentation & Predictive Analytics:** Traditional AI (machine learning) excels at analyzing large datasets to find patterns – for example, clustering customers into segments or predicting customer lifetime value. Retailers use AI to identify granular segments (e.g. “price-sensitive urban millennials who buy organic products”) and predict which customers are likely to respond to a given campaign. This improves **cross-team collaboration** as insights can be shared with merchandising or store operations (e.g. to ensure inventory for a promotion is in stock), and improves **leadership reporting** by quantifying segment-wise performance. AI-driven segmentation can also generate **customer insights** that feed into product development (what styles or features certain groups prefer). **KPIs:** Customer acquisition cost, segment-level conversion, and retention rates by segment. According to industry data, over **92% of businesses are leveraging AI-driven personalization to drive growth** as of mid-decade  – showing that most retailers recognize the value of AI analytics in marketing. An omnichannel retailer in Canada, for example, might use these tools to coordinate online offers with in-store events targeted at the same customer cohort, unified by AI insights.
	•	**Media Buying and Budget Optimization:** AI can automatically adjust bidding for digital ads and allocate marketing spend across channels (search, social, email, etc.) based on performance data. This ensures every dollar is used effectively, benefiting leadership with better **ROI visibility** and saving marketing analysts countless hours. AI platforms (like Google Ads’ automated bidding or Meta’s ad delivery optimization) continuously learn which ads perform best. **KPIs:** Return on ad spend (ROAS), cost per acquisition, and conversion rates. In practice, AI-driven media optimization can reduce customer acquisition cost significantly – in some cases, marketing campaigns see double-digit percentage improvements in ROAS after adopting AI for budget allocation . Walmart Canada’s marketing team, for instance, could use Google’s AI-driven ad platform to automatically emphasize products that are trending or overstocked, aligning marketing with merchandising needs (a cross-team benefit).

**Table 1. Example AI/GenAI Use Cases in Digital Marketing**

Overall, **AI in digital marketing allows a level of personalization and agility that drives both top-line growth and cost efficiency**. For Walmart Canada, these capabilities translate into more engaging digital campaigns for customers, more productive marketing teams (as repetitive tasks like baseline copywriting or audience selection are automated), and clearer insights for executives on marketing effectiveness. Tracking the mentioned KPIs will help leadership quantify the impact (e.g. seeing NPS rise as customers receive more relevant communications, or conversion rates climbing in AI-driven campaigns vs. traditional campaigns). Notably, the benefits are mutual: customers gain a more curated shopping experience – 80% of customers say they are more likely to purchase from brands that offer personalized experiences across online and offline channels  – and the business gains more loyal, higher-value customers.

**2. Post-Purchase Customer Experience**

The customer journey does not end at the point of sale. The **post-purchase experience** – including order fulfillment, delivery, returns, customer service, and feedback loops – strongly influences customer loyalty and lifetime value. AI tools help retailers proactively manage post-purchase interactions to ensure customers remain satisfied and engaged after a purchase. In an omnichannel context, this means smoothing the experience whether the customer bought online or in-store, and using data from those interactions to improve operations. Key AI/GenAI use cases in post-purchase experience include:
	•	**Proactive Customer Support and Issue Resolution:** AI can monitor post-purchase customer data (orders, shipping info, product usage data, etc.) and predict potential issues before they escalate. For example, if shipping is delayed, an AI system could automatically send an apology and coupon to the customer, or if a product is frequently returned, AI flags a potential quality issue to the product team. **Generative AI** chatbots (discussed more in the next section) can reach out to customers with setup guides or answer questions like “How do I assemble my new furniture?” using knowledge bases. This benefits **individual support agents** by reducing the volume of routine inquiries they must handle, and improves **customer satisfaction** by addressing needs instantly. **KPIs:** Customer satisfaction score (CSAT), **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**, and first contact resolution rate. By leveraging AI to be proactive, companies can increase NPS significantly – consumers appreciate when companies anticipate their needs. (As context, one study found **35% of customers have stopped doing business with a brand after a single poor service experience, such as waiting too long for help **. AI can mitigate such risks by speeding up response and resolution times.)
	•	**Returns and Exchanges Optimization:** Returns are a major aspect of post-purchase, especially in e-commerce. AI can streamline the returns process by **analyzing return reasons and automating logistics**. For instance, AI may detect that a certain clothing item is often returned due to sizing issues and alert the merchandising team to adjust the size guide or product description (a **cross-team collaboration** benefit, aligning customer feedback with product decisions). On the operational side, AI-powered systems (like **Returnly or Returnalyze**) assess the most efficient routing for a return (send back to distribution center vs. allow customer to return to nearest store, etc.), minimizing cost and time. Some retailers use machine learning to decide if a return is even necessary – in low-cost cases, the customer might be refunded and allowed to keep the item, turning a potentially negative experience into a positive surprise. **KPIs:** Return rate, time to process a return, cost per return, and secondary sales (exchanges or replacement purchases). According to industry research, automating returns and leveraging AI analytics can reduce processing costs significantly – by some estimates, **AI can cut return processing time by over 50%** and flag patterns (like fraudulent returns) that manual review might miss . An efficient, AI-assisted return process also boosts customer loyalty: a hassle-free returns experience can increase the likelihood of repeat purchases.
	•	**Sentiment Analysis and Feedback Loop:** Post-purchase interactions often include feedback – product reviews, customer surveys, social media comments, or calls to customer service. AI, particularly natural language processing (NLP), can analyze this unstructured feedback at scale to glean actionable insights. For example, an AI might analyze thousands of reviews of a new kitchen appliance and discover that a common complaint is about setup difficulty. This insight can be fed to the product development or documentation teams. It also benefits **leadership visibility**: executives get real-time dashboards of customer sentiment (for instance, an “NPS verbatim analysis” that highlights trending positive or negative topics). Companies like Ekimetrics have used AI to parse verbatim customer reviews and correlate them with NPS, helping identify drivers of satisfaction . **KPIs:** NPS (and drivers thereof), number of negative comments resolved, and improvement in product ratings over time. By closing the loop – using AI to turn feedback into improvements – retailers can see measurable increases in customer satisfaction and product quality. A Canadian grocer could, for example, deploy an AI tool to monitor social media for any post-purchase complaints about curbside pickup experiences and address them swiftly, thereby protecting brand reputation.
	•	**Personalized Follow-up Engagement:** AI can determine the best way to re-engage a customer post-purchase. This might mean sending personalized content like how-to videos, maintenance tips for the product, or recommending complementary products. For instance, after a customer buys a baby stroller, an AI system might queue up a follow-up email with a tutorial video and suggest accessories like car seat adapters – all tailored to that specific model. GenAI can automate the creation of these follow-up messages in a friendly, conversational tone. These touches make customers feel cared for individually, enhancing loyalty. **KPIs:** Repeat purchase rate, email open/click rates on follow-up communications, and churn rate. **Benchmark:** Engaging customers with relevant recommendations post-purchase can significantly increase repeat sales; some retailers see substantial uplift in 2nd-order rates by doing so. Moreover, loyalty program integration (see section on Membership & Loyalty) means these post-purchase engagements can tie into points or rewards, further incentivizing customers to return.

**Benefit to team members:** In post-purchase contexts, AI reduces the burden on customer service teams by handling routine inquiries via automation (letting human agents focus on complex cases), and it assists operations managers by highlighting process issues (e.g. “Warehouse A is causing late deliveries”). **Collaboration across teams** is enhanced because AI surfaces data (like common return reasons or support FAQs) that marketing, product, and operations teams can all use to make improvements. For leadership, AI provides **visibility** into overall customer happiness after the sale – often encapsulated in metrics like NPS or retention rate – and can even quantify the revenue impact of improving those metrics.

In summary, **AI-driven post-purchase initiatives directly affect loyalty**. Satisfied customers not only come back but also become promoters of the brand. Conversely, poor experiences can rapidly erode loyalty – hence the focus on KPIs like NPS and repeat purchase rates. Omnichannel retailers in Canada and globally report higher customer retention when leveraging AI in after-sales service. For example, according to CharterQR’s industry review, retailers that use AI to personalize follow-ups and swiftly resolve issues saw a noticeable increase in customer retention and frequency of purchases  . By tracking those improvements and continuously training AI systems on new data, companies like Walmart Canada can ensure the post-purchase journey is as optimized and pleasant as the purchase journey itself.

**3. Chatbot (AI-Powered Conversational Agents)**

Chatbots have become a frontline tool for customer engagement in retail, handling everything from customer service queries to product discovery. Modern AI chatbots use advanced natural language processing and **large language models** (LLMs) to understand and respond to customer inquiries in a human-like manner. In an omnichannel retail environment, chatbots can be deployed on the website, mobile app, messaging platforms (like WhatsApp or SMS), and even in-store kiosks. They provide 24/7 assistance, improving responsiveness and freeing human staff for complex tasks. Key use cases and benefits of AI and GenAI in chatbots include:
	•	**Customer Service and FAQ Handling:** One primary use case is addressing common customer service questions instantly. **GenAI-powered chatbots** can handle queries about order status, return policies, store hours, product availability, etc., with a high degree of understanding. For example, if a customer asks, “Where is my order?” the chatbot can integrate with tracking systems and provide an immediate update. This greatly enhances **individual agent efficiency** by deflecting repetitive inquiries – agents can focus on thornier issues. From the business perspective, this yields significant cost savings: diverting inquiries to self-service chatbots lowers the volume of calls/emails that contact center agents must handle. According to Qualtrics, effective call deflection through AI self-service can **reduce support costs by up to 40%** . **KPIs:** Chatbot containment rate (the percentage of conversations resolved without human intervention), average response time, and customer satisfaction with the bot interaction. It’s not uncommon for well-designed retail chatbots to resolve **50–80% of routine queries** without escalation. In fact, one example calculation showed a **76.8% deflection rate** when self-service resources were properly utilized . Maintaining customer satisfaction is crucial – so measuring post-chat survey scores or bot NPS is important to ensure the bot is helpful. Overall, a high containment rate paired with high CSAT indicates the chatbot is both efficient and customer-friendly.
	•	**Conversational Commerce & Product Discovery:** Chatbots are not only for support – they can also drive sales. AI chat assistants can guide customers in choosing products by asking questions about their needs and preferences. For instance, **Walmart** in the U.S. launched a “**Text to Shop**” service where customers can simply text message their requests (like “I need milk and eggs”) and the AI-powered system will add items to their cart or suggest products . This merges shopping with a chat interface. Another innovative example: **Instacart’s ChatGPT plugin**, which allows users to ask for meal planning advice in natural language (e.g. “Plan a dinner party for 5 with a vegetarian option”) and then have the bot fill an Instacart basket with the needed ingredients . These generative AI use cases illustrate how chatbots can act as shopping assistants. The benefit is a more engaging customer-facing digital product – it’s like giving each customer a personal shopper on demand. **KPIs:** Conversion rate of chatbot interactions (did the conversation lead to a sale or add-to-cart), average order value from chatbot-led sessions, and engagement metrics (how many customers use the chatbot for shopping assistance). A Statista survey found **36% of shoppers reported that chatbots have influenced their purchase decisions** (either always or frequently) by providing useful information or recommendations . Retailers deploying conversational commerce bots aim to raise these conversion influence metrics. Additionally, tracking drop-off points in chat conversations can highlight where the bot needs improvement (e.g., if many users ask to speak to an agent at the same step).
	•	**Personalized Support with Context Retention:** Advanced AI chatbots can be integrated with customer data to provide personalized responses. For example, if the chatbot knows it’s speaking with a loyalty program member, it can greet them by name and tailor offers or responses based on their purchase history (“Hi John, welcome back! I see you recently bought running shoes – are you looking for related gear?”). **Omnichannel customer identification** (see section 6) plays a role here by feeding the chatbot a unified profile of the customer. This personalization improves the user experience and can increase engagement and sales. It also demonstrates **cross-team collaboration**: the chatbot draws on marketing data (past purchases, loyalty status) and perhaps even inventory data (to only recommend in-stock items). **KPIs:** Personalized offer redemption rate, chatbot NPS, and containment rate for known vs. unknown users (we generally see higher success when the bot has context about the user). **Benchmark:** Many leading retailers report that adding personalization to chatbot interactions shortens the conversation length needed to resolve issues (because the bot can anticipate needs). McKinsey observes that “the more personalized a chatbot is for a given customer, the shorter their conversation – and the higher the conversion rate” . This implies that investing in contextual AI chatbots not only improves efficiency but also customer satisfaction (since customers get to what they want faster).
	•	**Internal Bots for Team Members:** While customer-facing chatbots get a lot of attention, AI chatbots for internal use are equally valuable. For example, an internal chatbot might assist store associates or call center agents by quickly fetching information (“What’s the policy for returning electronics after 30 days?”) or summarizing recent customer interactions. Walmart internally has experimented with tools like “Ask Sam,” a voice-activated assistant for store associates to get answers on the fly. These internal bots improve **operational efficiency** and ensure consistent information is used across the company. **KPIs:** Average time saved per query for employees, reduction in training time (new staff can ask the bot instead of always relying on a supervisor), and consistency of answers (measured via quality audits). Such bots break down silos as well – for instance, a merchandising team member could query a chatbot for up-to-date sales figures or customer feedback on a product, rather than digging through reports.

From a **leadership perspective**, chatbots provide visibility through rich analytics: executives can see volumes of customer inquiries and what topics are trending (which might influence product fixes or new initiatives). A dashboard might show that “50% of chatbot questions this week were about order tracking” – valuable insight into customer concerns. This can inform operations to improve delivery estimates, for example. Moreover, leadership will watch the cost and ROI: with chatbots able to handle a large portion of interactions, companies often achieve **lower cost-to-serve** per customer. Industry data supports this – it’s estimated that **95% of customer interactions may be supported by AI (chatbots) by 2025** , as companies strive to scale service without equivalent headcount increases. Retailers using AI chatbots daily are seeing tangible ROI in the form of reduced contact center workload and improved customer sentiment.

From the **customer viewpoint**, bots provide instant service. Notably, **68% of customers have used a chatbot for a customer service interaction in the past** , and as AI improves, consumer comfort with bots is growing. Still, successful deployment requires monitoring the **handoff to humans** – bots should seamlessly pass customers to a live agent when issues are beyond their capability, to avoid frustration.

In summary, AI and GenAI chatbots are becoming a standard part of omnichannel retail strategy. They benefit team member efficiency by automating repetitive dialogs, improve cross-team outcomes by capturing customer intents that other teams can act on, give leadership real-time insight into customer needs, and generate customer insights by analyzing chat logs at scale. All of this results in better customer-facing digital experiences. For Walmart Canada, implementing a robust AI chatbot (on web, app, and messaging channels) could mean faster responses for millions of inquiries annually and even new sales via conversational commerce. As a benchmark, **47% of consumers are open to buying items through a chatbot interface**  – a significant opportunity to drive sales in a convenient way.

**4. Voice Bot and Voice Assistants**

Voice bots extend the concept of chatbots into spoken language channels. They leverage speech recognition and voice synthesis to engage customers (or employees) through voice-based interactions. In a retail context, voice AI appears in two main forms: **telephony (phone) voice bots** that handle calls, and **smart assistant integrations** (like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or Siri skills) that allow voice shopping or inquiries. The rising prevalence of smart speakers and voice search means retailers must consider voice as part of an omnichannel strategy. Key use cases and benefits of AI/GenAI in voice bots include:
	•	**AI-Powered IVR (Interactive Voice Response) for Call Centers:** Traditional phone IVR systems often frustrate customers with touch-tone menus (“Press 1 for store hours, press 2 for…”). AI voice bots replace these with natural language systems. A customer can call and simply say, *“I need help with an online order I placed yesterday,”* and the voice bot (using NLP) will interpret the request and route or handle it appropriately. Advances in speech recognition and understanding enable these bots to resolve many issues entirely via voice. For example, a voice bot can handle order tracking requests, provide store location information, or even process a refund or exchange by guiding the caller through the steps. The benefit to **individual agents** is similar to chatbots: fewer routine calls land with humans, shortening queues and wait times. From the business side, this improves service availability (voice bots can handle spikes in call volume without additional staff) and consistency. **KPIs:** IVR containment rate (same concept as chatbot containment, but for calls), average call duration, call abandonment rate, and caller satisfaction. Best-in-class voice IVRs can **resolve 30-40% of calls** without needing a human agent. For instance, one pharmacy reported achieving a **40% call containment rate** with an AI-driven voice solution, meaning 40% of incoming calls were handled start-to-finish by the voice bot . Additionally, **cost per call** is a relevant metric – since voice bots cost a fraction of a live agent’s time, increasing containment directly lowers cost. A McKinsey analysis found that companies leveraging AI in their contact channels significantly **reduced new staffing needs by ~15% and saw AHT (average handle time) drop 30%** in early deployments , highlighting the efficiency gains of automating voice and chat interactions.
	•	**Voice Commerce and Smart Speaker Integrations:** An emerging area is allowing customers to shop or get information using voice assistants at home. For example, Walmart partnered with Google to let customers add items to their Walmart grocery cart using Google Assistant (“Hey Google, add milk to my Walmart cart”). Similarly, Amazon’s Alexa naturally allows voice ordering from Amazon’s catalog. These use cases make shopping even more convenient – customers can make requests while cooking or driving, without needing to use a screen. For Walmart Canada, developing a skill for Alexa or Google that ties into their online store could tap into this hands-free shopping trend. Analysts predict that **voice commerce could account for 30% of all e-commerce sales by 2030**  as consumers grow more comfortable conversing with AI to get things done. **KPIs:** Number of active users of voice shopping, order frequency via voice, and successful fulfillment of voice orders (since interpreting product names via voice can be tricky, a low error rate is important). Another KPI is **customer acquisition/engagement via voice** – e.g., how many new customers tried shopping with Walmart because it was available on their Google Home device. Retailers that have implemented voice ordering generally report modest but growing usage; the key is to be present in the voice ecosystem as it expands. **Industry example:** Domino’s Pizza’s voice assistant (Dom) lets customers order pizza by speaking – it has been reported to handle a significant volume of orders, indicating that for certain quick transactions, users enjoy the convenience of voice. Leadership at retail firms will monitor if voice channels drive incremental sales or if they simply shift orders from app/website to voice for convenience; either way, being channel-agnostic in offering service is part of an omnichannel strategy.
	•	**In-Store Voice Assistants:** In physical stores, voice AI can enhance the experience for both customers and associates. Customers might interact with a voice-enabled kiosk or store navigation app – for example, **Home Depot’s mobile app** allows voice search for products; a customer in-store can speak “find paint brushes” and get aisle information . Similarly, associates might use a headset or mobile app to ask a voice assistant about inventory (“How many of item X are in stock in the back?”) instead of manually looking it up. This speeds up service on the floor, benefiting **operational staff** and ultimately customers. **KPIs:** Reduction in time to answer customer questions in-store, employee feedback on the helpfulness of voice tools, and potentially sales uplift in stores where these tools are used (if customers can find items faster, they are more likely to buy them rather than give up). Such in-store applications blur into IoT and smart devices, but they leverage the same voice recognition AI.
	•	**Voice Biometrics for Security and Personalization:** On the security side (tying into account security function), voice AI can recognize customers by voice print. Banks have used this (“your voice is your password”) to authenticate callers quickly. Retailers with financial services (credit cards, etc.) might use voice biometrics in their call centers to verify the identity of callers within seconds, improving both security and call handle time. While this is a niche use case, it’s worth noting as it enhances **account security** (discussed later) through AI. **KPIs:** Authentication success rate, reduction in authentication time (which can shave 30-60 seconds off call time, significantly affecting AHT), and fraud prevented via voice-match fails (attempted impostor calls flagged).

Voice bots, by their nature, **strongly impact customer-facing digital service quality**. Many customers still choose to use the phone for complex or urgent issues; having an AI that can speak naturally and solve problems improves their impression of the brand’s service. However, it’s critical to design voice interactions carefully – nothing turns customers away like a voice bot that can’t understand them. Continuous training with diverse accents and phrases, and providing easy opt-out to a human agent, are best practices.

From an **executive viewpoint**, voice AI adds another dimension to an omnichannel offering. It can reduce costs similarly to text chatbots and even further shorten resolution time (since speaking can be faster than typing). It also provides a modern, innovative image for the company. KPIs like containment and customer satisfaction will demonstrate if the voice bot is truly adding value. Notably, **customer satisfaction can remain high with voice self-service** if executed well – one study found that **when given a well-designed self-service option, over 80% of customers were able to resolve their issue and felt satisfied**  . This underscores that voice bots, much like chatbots, should be seen as complementary to human agents, not just a cost-cutting replacement.

In sum, **voice bots leverage AI to provide faster, hands-free interactions**. For Walmart Canada’s product management leaders, exploring voice interfaces – whether improving the phone experience with AI or enabling voice shopping through popular assistants – can be an important step to meet customers wherever they are. Given the bilingual (English/French) customer base in Canada, any voice AI would need multi-language capability, which AI providers increasingly support. Tracking engagement and satisfaction across languages would be another nuance in KPI tracking for voice solutions in this market.

**5. Contact Centre Applications (Agent Assistance and Analytics)**

Beyond customer-facing bots, AI is revolutionizing the internal workings of **contact centers** (customer service centers). This function includes live support via phone, email, chat, and social media, usually handled by human agents. AI can be deployed to **assist agents in real-time, analyze interactions for quality and insights, and optimize workforce management.** The goal is to make customer support more efficient, effective, and intelligent. In a large omnichannel retailer context, contact centers handle millions of interactions annually – small efficiency gains per interaction translate into huge savings and better customer experience. Key AI/GenAI use cases in contact centers include:
	•	**Agent “Copilots” and Real-Time Assistance:** Generative AI can act as a live assistant to human agents during customer interactions. For instance, as an agent is chatting or speaking with a customer, an AI could listen (or read) in real time and suggest helpful information or next steps. If a customer says, “My package hasn’t arrived and it’s a week late,” the AI could automatically surface the order details and shipping status on the agent’s screen and even draft an apology response with an update. Technologies like **Google’s Contact Center AI** and **IBM Watson Assistant** are used in this manner, and newer LLM-based tools can even draft full email/chat responses for agents to approve. This dramatically improves **individual agent efficiency** – agents spend less time searching for info or composing messages. It also helps **training new agents**, as the AI provides guidance on the fly. **KPIs:** Average Handle Time (AHT) – a critical metric – often drops with AI assistance because issues are resolved faster. One financial services company saw AHT reduced by **30% in the first 90 days** of using an AI knowledge assistant . Another KPI is First Contact Resolution (FCR) – with better info at hand, agents can resolve more issues in one go, improving FCR. Agent satisfaction can also be tracked; often these tools reduce stress on agents by easing their workload. In practice, AI “copilots” can reduce the time agents spend on after-call work (e.g. writing case notes or follow-up emails) as well – some have reported **saving ~12% of time per interaction** by auto-summarizing calls .
	•	**Automated Summarization and Case Notes (GenAI application):** After a customer call or chat, agents traditionally must write a summary or log details in CRM systems. GenAI can perform this task almost instantly. By analyzing the transcript of the conversation, an AI can generate a concise summary, list of issues raised, and resolution steps. This benefits agents (less tedious paperwork) and managers (more consistent logs to review). Salesforce, for example, has introduced Einstein GPT features that auto-summarize service cases. **KPIs:** After-Call Work time, which is part of AHT, and data quality of case notes. Shorter and more consistent summaries mean agents can move to the next customer sooner, and supervisors can more easily review what happened. Leadership will note the overall reduction in handling time and potentially an increase in volume handled per agent per hour.
	•	**Quality Assurance and Training Analytics:** Contact centers typically monitor a sample of calls/chats for quality (were the correct greetings used, was the issue resolved, was the customer treated well?). AI can **listen to or read 100% of interactions**, which is transformative. NLP algorithms can flag calls where a customer is angry (sentiment analysis), or where certain keywords (like “cancel my account”) appear, alerting supervisors in real-time to intervene or follow up. They can also score agents on adherence to scripts or policies. This level of comprehensive monitoring means training needs are identified faster and customer pain points bubble up quickly. **KPIs:** Quality scores, compliance metrics, and reduction in negative outcomes (like churn or complaints) due to early detection. Also, measuring the time QA analysts spend – AI can cut that drastically by handling initial scoring. Some contact centers report needing **15% fewer staff** for the same workload after introducing AI analytics, reallocating those resources to more value-add activities . Moreover, correlating AI-derived sentiment scores with NPS can give leadership a direct line of sight into how daily interactions affect loyalty.
	•	**Workforce Management and Volume Forecasting:** AI is also used to predict contact volumes and optimize scheduling of agents – ensuring the right number of agents with the right skills are on duty at the right times. Machine learning models factor in historical patterns, promotions, seasonal events, etc. to forecast how many calls/chats to expect. This results in better **operational data analysis** and cost control (not overstaffing or understaffing). **KPIs:** Forecast accuracy, service level (percentage of calls answered within e.g. 30 seconds), and labor utilization rates. Retailers with weekly sales cycles (like big weekend promotions) can feed that data to AI to anticipate support needs (for example, after a major sale, expect more calls about order status). Accurate forecasting and scheduling maintain customer service responsiveness without burning out staff.
	•	**Multilingual Support:** In Canada’s bilingual environment, having AI that can assist or translate between English and French (and possibly other languages common in Canada) is beneficial. GenAI models can translate customer queries in real-time or help agents respond in a language they’re less comfortable with. This ensures consistent service quality across languages. **KPIs:** Customer satisfaction scores segmented by language, and percentage of interactions successfully handled in languages other than English. A successful use case is using AI to allow a primarily English-speaking agent to assist a French-speaking customer by translating on the fly – improving first contact resolution instead of having to schedule a French agent callback.

For **leadership**, AI in the contact center provides improved **visibility and reporting**. Dashboards can show live sentiment across all calls, trending issues (e.g., a spike in inquiries about a promo code not working could alert marketing to fix an error quickly), and agent performance metrics with more objectivity (AI scoring). This means faster decision-making and a more agile response to any emerging customer service crises. It also provides hard ROI numbers: e.g., if AI automation handles 20% of what agents used to, that translates to a clear cost savings or ability to redeploy headcount.

From a **customer insights generation** standpoint, the contact center is a goldmine of data – every support ticket is feedback. AI analysis of this data can reveal systemic problems (if many people ask “Is product X coming back in stock?”, that’s a signal for merchandising). It also helps **cross-team collaboration** because summaries of customer issues can be easily shared with product, marketing, or store operations teams. At Walmart Canada, for example, if the AI finds that “curbside pickup” issues are trending in the contact center, that insight can be passed to the e-commerce operations team to investigate and resolve any process issues, illustrating how AI breaks silos.

It’s important to monitor how these AI deployments impact **customer-facing outcomes** like resolution speed and satisfaction. There’s evidence that quicker, more informed service improves customer sentiment – e.g., **reducing AHT by 40% can boost conversion rates on service-to-sales calls** (as per McKinsey, shorter support calls with the right information can lead to upsell opportunities) . Customers also feel more confident in a brand that handles their issues swiftly.

In summary, AI in the contact center augments human agents (“co-piloting” rather than replacing), automates back-office tasks, and mines service interactions for strategic insights. By tracking metrics like AHT, FCR, CSAT/NPS, and containment, product management leaders can quantify improvements. A formal report might show, for instance: *“After introducing AI agent assist and automated summaries, our Average Handle Time dropped from 6 minutes to 4.5 minutes (25% improvement), and First Contact Resolution improved by 10 percentage points. This equates to an annual savings of $X in operational costs and a 5-point increase in NPS, from 45 to 50.”* These are the kinds of outcomes industry benchmarks are starting to report, and they resonate strongly at the leadership level .

**6. Omni-Channel Customer Identification**

One of the toughest challenges in an omnichannel retail environment is recognizing the customer as a single individual across various touchpoints: in-store, online, mobile app, call center, etc. **Omni-channel customer identification** means building a unified, 360-degree view of each customer. AI plays a pivotal role in merging data from disparate sources and resolving identities, which leads to more personalized experiences and better analytics. Key use cases and benefits:
	•	**Identity Resolution with AI:** Customers might interact using different identifiers – e.g., an email online, a phone number in-store (for loyalty), a name with a slight spelling variation when talking to support. AI can probabilistically match and merge these records using fuzzy logic and pattern recognition. Machine learning models consider various data points (name similarity, geolocation, device IDs, purchase patterns) to decide if two records belong to the same person. This reduces duplicate customer records and **data silos**, enabling a single customer profile. **Benefit to team members:** Marketers and customer service reps have access to complete information (purchase history, preferences) regardless of channel, improving efficiency and quality of interaction. **Collaboration:** All departments (marketing, e-commerce, in-store sales, loyalty, customer service) refer to the same profile, which fosters a consistent approach. **KPIs:** Identity match rate (what percentage of records could be unified), reduction in duplicate accounts, and the increase in known customer interactions (if more interactions are linked to identified profiles rather than remaining anonymous). **Industry example:** Loblaw (a major Canadian retailer) undertook a data unification project using Microsoft Azure AI to break down silos between their grocery, pharmacy, and loyalty systems. By integrating Microsoft’s AI tech, **Loblaw redesigned its customer data to anonymize and aggregate across experiences, and built a feature to customize offers at scale for unified loyalty members** . This kind of identity resolution was fundamental to their ability to personalize at scale. The result is that a customer who shops at Shoppers Drug Mart (pharmacy) and Loblaw grocery under the same loyalty account can be recognized and rewarded holistically.
	•	**360° Customer Profiles and Insights:** Once data is unified, AI can analyze the complete customer journey across channels. This generates richer **customer insights** – e.g., “Customers who browse online and then buy in-store have higher lifetime value than those who only shop in one channel” or “This customer often buys online but returns in store.” Such insights help leadership with **visibility** into omni-channel customer behavior and inform strategy (perhaps investing more in buy-online-pickup-in-store services if those customers are most valuable). Additionally, predictive AI can use unified profiles to forecast customer lifetime value, churn risk, or next-best product. For example, Salesforce and Adobe offer Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) with embedded AI that score customers on metrics like engagement or likelihood to purchase certain categories. **Benefit to operations staff:** store associates or call center agents can see notes like “High-value customer” or recommendations in their interface, which can guide how they service that customer. **KPIs:** Cross-channel retention rate (do customers stay within the brand across channels?), incremental revenue from personalized cross-sell, and improved marketing attribution accuracy (knowing which touchpoint actually drove the sale). A unified profile enables proper credit assignment – e.g., if a customer saw a Facebook ad and later bought in store, AI-based identity linkage will tie that behavior together, helping measure the true ROI of marketing efforts.
	•	**Seamless Cross-Channel Experiences:** With AI linking customer identities, retailers can implement experiences such as **“start online, finish in-store”** without losing context. For example, a customer builds a wishlist or cart online; when they walk into a store, an associate or a kiosk could retrieve that cart by recognizing the customer (via loyalty ID or even via computer vision). AI-based facial recognition or beacon technologies can identify opted-in loyalty customers as they enter a store and maybe present personalized offers on their phone – though this must be used carefully with privacy in mind. The benefit is a **customer-facing product coherence**: the brand “remembers” the customer’s journey. **KPIs:** Conversion rate of cross-channel journeys, decrease in customers having to repeat information, and consistency metrics (for instance, the percentage of customers who get the same promotion online and offline due to unified profiles). Customers certainly expect this: **90% of consumers expect consistent interactions across channels, and 89% get frustrated at having to repeat their issue or identity**  . AI-driven omni-ID directly tackles that frustration by ensuring the context travels with the customer. For Walmart Canada, this could mean if a customer calls support about an online order, the agent immediately knows if that customer also recently made an in-store purchase and can tailor the conversation (“I see you also bought something in our store last week – thank you for shopping across our channels!”). Conversely, an in-store associate might know that a customer had an issue with a previous online order (flagged in the profile), allowing them to proactively address it if appropriate – this level of context can turn a poor experience into a chance to impress the customer.
	•	**Security and Fraud Detection in Unified Profiles:** A side benefit of unified identity is improved account security. AI can detect anomalies in a profile that span channels – for example, if one loyalty account is used to make simultaneous purchases in two different cities, that could be a flag for fraud (like someone cloned the account). We’ll discuss fraud more in the next section, but from an identification standpoint, AI maintaining profiles helps spot when something doesn’t add up. **KPIs:** Reduction in duplicate or fraudulent accounts, and detection of account takeovers.

Implementing omni-channel identification requires robust data governance and often customer consent (especially under privacy laws – being transparent about data use is key). AI can assist by anonymizing and securely matching data as in the Loblaw example .

For **leadership**, the unified view enabled by AI means more accurate high-level metrics. For example, leadership can see **unique customers** served (without duplication) and their total spend across channels. This could show, say, that a seemingly flat store sales number is actually being offset by those same customers spending more online – a nuance that would be invisible if data stayed siloed. It also allows calculation of **true Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** across the business, which guides long-term strategy and allocation of resources (marketing budgets, loyalty perks, etc.). A Tata Consulting Services whitepaper on unified profiles noted that **leveraging AI-powered unified profiles can drive higher CLV through better journey orchestration** .

From a **team collaboration** perspective, when everyone trusts a centralized AI-driven customer dataset, it breaks down organizational silos. Loblaw’s AI integration was cited as *“changing the culture and how people work… taking subject matter experts from different areas and bringing them together on one project”* . This highlights how an AI initiative (unifying loyalty data) led to cross-departmental teamwork, which is a cultural benefit beyond the tech itself.

In practice, **benchmark improvements** from omni-channel personalization are notable. A report by Forrester (via Eagle Eye) indicated that companies effectively personalizing loyalty across channels see strong engagement: Loblaw’s PC Optimum loyalty program, by using AI to personalize offers across in-store and digital, has kept **over 16 million members actively engaged**, and its premium tier (PC Insiders) grew **11% per quarter** with personalized exclusives . These figures suggest that when customers feel recognized and receive value across touchpoints, they respond with greater loyalty and spend.

Finally, tracking the right KPIs is crucial. **Matching rates** (how many disparate IDs were linked to unified profiles) indicate the success of the AI identity resolution. **Customer satisfaction** can be measured via surveys specifically about cross-channel experience (e.g., “The company understands my needs across different ways I shop: Agree/Disagree”). Improvement in that sentiment over time is a qualitative KPI for omni-channel success.

**7. Account Security and Fraud Reduction**

In retail, as transactions and accounts move online, **security and fraud prevention** have become top priorities. AI is a game-changer in detecting and preventing fraudulent activities, which range from payment fraud (stolen credit cards, fake transactions) to account takeover, loyalty program fraud, return fraud, and even in-store theft. AI and GenAI assist in two main ways: by analyzing patterns to detect anomalies (fraud detection) and by enhancing verification and authentication (security). The benefits are clear – reduced financial losses, increased trust from customers, and protection of brand reputation. Key use cases:
	•	**Payment Fraud Detection (E-commerce Transactions):** Machine learning models are widely used to approve or flag transactions in real-time on retail websites. These AI models are trained on historical transaction data labeled as fraudulent or legitimate, learning patterns that humans might miss. For example, an AI might notice that a particular device ID has attempted 10 purchases with 10 different cards in an hour – a likely fraud pattern – and block those transactions. Companies like **Mastercard and Visa** use AI in their networks to score transactions for fraud risk. The result is fewer chargebacks and fraudulent sales. AI has proven to **improve fraud detection accuracy by over 50% compared to rules-based systems** , according to industry reports. At the same time, AI can reduce “false positives” – legitimate transactions wrongly declined – which is crucial for revenue and customer experience. **JP Morgan** noted that using AI in payment screening led to a **15–20% reduction in account validation rejections** (i.e. fewer good customers being falsely flagged) while still lowering fraud levels . **KPIs:** Fraud loss as a percentage of sales (aim to decrease), number of fraudulent incidents prevented, and false positive rate (aim to decrease declines of good orders). For leadership, an important metric is **fraud savings** – e.g., “our AI blocked $X million in attempted fraudulent orders this quarter.” Many retailers see AI pay for itself quickly in this domain through loss prevention. For instance, **KPMG** reports that AI anti-fraud engines can reduce fraudulent transactions by up to **40%** on top of existing measures .
	•	**Account Takeover & Identity Fraud Prevention:** Retailers with customer accounts (for e-commerce or loyalty) face risks of attackers trying to hijack those accounts (using stolen passwords, etc.). AI can monitor login attempts, changes in account behavior, or loyalty point redemption patterns to spot likely account takeovers. For example, if a customer account suddenly logs in from a new country and orders expensive electronics, whereas historically they bought groceries in Canada, the AI system can flag or challenge this activity. **Benefit to operations/security teams:** They can act faster and more precisely, focusing only on high-risk cases the AI flags. Some AI systems employ **behavioral biometrics** – analyzing how a user types or navigates – to differentiate a legitimate user from a bot or impostor. **KPIs:** Number of account takeovers prevented, reduction in manual review workload for fraud analysts, and customer impact (ideally measured by reduction in fraud-related complaints). Also, mean time to detect incidents is a critical metric (AI often works in real-time, whereas manual audits might catch things days later).
	•	**Loyalty and Coupon Fraud Detection:** Loyalty programs can be targets for fraud (e.g., people creating fake accounts to exploit signup offers, or using stolen loyalty points). AI can identify patterns like multiple accounts tied to the same individual or unnatural redemption patterns. For example, if one person suddenly redeems hundreds of coupons from different accounts, AI could correlate data and flag a potential fraud ring. This is an area where **cross-team collaboration** (between the loyalty program managers and security analysts) is enhanced by AI insights. **KPIs:** Fraudulent loyalty accounts shut down, points theft incidents, and improvement in loyalty liability accuracy (since fraud distortions are removed).
	•	**Return Fraud and Abuse:** AI also helps identify fraudulent returns (e.g., wardrobing in fashion – where someone buys an item to wear once and return – or returns of stolen merchandise). By analyzing return patterns (frequency, value, item condition feedback, etc.), AI models can flag potentially abusive behavior, which can then be handled with tighter policies or investigations. Retailers have started using AI to decide return eligibility in real-time; for instance, if a customer has a history of questionable returns, the system might require a manager approval for their next return. **KPIs:** Reduction in fraudulent returns (measured by investigative outcomes or policy enforcement), and an overall return rate stability (ensuring honest customers aren’t deterred, measured via customer satisfaction around returns).
	•	**Physical Store Loss Prevention (Theft) with AI Vision:** In stores, AI-powered cameras and computer vision (often using techniques like object recognition and anomaly detection) can monitor for shoplifting or ticket switching. Walmart has used computer vision AI in some stores to monitor self-checkout and aisles – notably, one report indicated **Walmart reduced shoplifting by 25% through real-time video analysis using AI** . The AI can, for example, detect if an item was put into a bag without being scanned at self-checkout and alert an attendant. **KPIs:** Shrinkage (loss) rate in AI-monitored stores vs others, number of theft incidents caught or deterred, and employee safety incidents (ensuring interventions are safe). This ties into account security in a broader sense – protecting assets.

The role of GenAI in security is more on the analysis and simulation side. For instance, generative models can create **synthetic fraud scenarios** to test the fraud detection systems (simulating new fraud patterns). They can also be used in communications – e.g., generating automated but polite messages to notify customers of suspicious activity on their account, which improves customer experience around fraud (often a delicate moment).

For **leadership visibility**, AI provides comprehensive fraud dashboards: total prevented fraud, trending attack vectors, etc. This helps in risk management discussions and allocating resources (e.g., investing in more fraud prevention or deciding what level of fraud loss is acceptable vs customer friction). It also helps assure stakeholders (including shareholders and regulators) that advanced measures are in place. According to a FICO survey, **77% of consumers expect their banks (and by extension, large retailers handling payments) to use AI to protect against fraud**  – so being able to say “we use cutting-edge AI to secure customer transactions” is a trust signal.

A delicate balance measured by KPIs is **fraud prevention vs. customer friction**. AI’s goal is to minimize false positives – every legitimate customer blocked or hassled is a bad experience and potentially lost sales. The earlier stat from JPMC (15-20% reduction in false declines)  is crucial: it shows AI can actually make security *customer-friendlier* by precisely targeting fraud. **Customer insights** from fraud analysis also inform marketing and operations; for example, identifying that certain products are frequently targeted for fraudulent orders might influence how those orders are reviewed or require 2-factor authentication.

In conclusion, AI fortifies account security and fraud prevention by catching more bad actors while inconveniencing fewer good customers. **Benchmarks:** McKinsey cites AI can cut fraud detection costs by 30%  and organizations using AI+analytics have halved the duration of fraud incidents on average (meaning they stop fraud twice as fast) . As Walmart Canada offers more online services (e.g., grocery delivery, marketplace, financial services), these AI-driven safeguards become indispensable. The key KPIs to watch are fraud loss reduction (financial impact), false positive reduction (customer impact), and incident response time (operational efficiency).

**8. Membership and Loyalty Programs**

Membership and loyalty programs are vital for customer retention and increased lifetime value. AI and GenAI amplify these programs by enabling personalization at scale, smarter reward structures, and better understanding of what drives loyalty for different customer segments. In a corporate context, Walmart Canada might consider its own membership program (akin to Walmart+ in the US) and its credit card loyalty rewards; even without a formal points program, there are membership-like elements such as repeat customer incentives or subscription services. Key AI/GenAI use cases in loyalty include:
	•	**Personalized Offers and Rewards:** AI analyzes each loyalty member’s purchasing patterns to deliver bespoke promotions that resonate with that individual. Instead of blanket discounts, customers get relevant coupons or point offers (e.g., extra points on categories they frequently buy, or a discount on an item they’ve browsed online). **GenAI** can even automate the creation of personalized content to deliver these offers – for instance, generating a paragraph in an email like, “Hi Jane, we thought you might love this new eco-friendly product since you bought similar items in the past – here’s a 20% off coupon as a thanks for being a loyal customer.” The Loblaw **PC Optimum** program is a prime example: using Azure AI, Loblaw delivers targeted offers to millions of members based on their unique preferences and online behavior, effectively customizing the loyalty experience at scale . This has enhanced engagement, as members feel the program is tailored to them. **KPIs:** Offer redemption rate, incremental revenue per loyalty customer, and increase in frequency of shop. Benchmarks show personalized loyalty communications can drive **incremental spend and margin improvements**: a McKinsey study found companies piloting personalized loyalty/pricing saw **2–4% increases in gross margin dollars** through better targeting of offers (effectively giving rewards where they spur extra purchases) . Furthermore, tracking NPS or satisfaction among loyalty members often reveals higher scores when the program is AI-personalized, because customers perceive greater value.
	•	**Churn Prediction and Retention Campaigns:** AI can identify which loyalty members are at risk of disengaging or churning (stopping shopping with the brand). By examining factors like declining visit frequency, lower spend, or not using earned rewards, machine learning models assign a “churn risk score” to each member. This enables proactive retention actions – e.g., sending a compelling offer or reminder to those high-risk members. For example, an omnichannel retailer could use AI to notice a customer hasn’t made a purchase in 3 months (where their usual cadence is monthly), and trigger a win-back offer such as bonus points if they shop this month. **KPIs:** Retention rate of loyalty members, reactivation rate (percent of lapsed members who resume activity after targeted offers), and overall loyalty program attrition. If AI-driven interventions are working, one should see a measurable lift in retention vs. a control group. Industry data suggests that data-driven retention campaigns can cut churn significantly – even reducing churn by a few percentage points can translate to millions in saved revenue given the high CLV of loyal customers.
	•	**Tier Management and VIP Treatment:** Many loyalty programs have tiers (Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc.). AI can help manage these by predicting which customers are likely to ascend to higher tiers and nudging them accordingly (e.g., “You’re just $50 away from Gold status, here’s a personalized suggestion to help you get there”). It can also ensure the top-tier members get white-glove treatment: for instance, routing their support calls faster or giving them early access to sales – all tracked and triggered by AI systems that recognize the customer’s status in real time. **KPIs:** Tier upgrade rate, satisfaction of top-tier members (sometimes measured through separate surveys or NPS for VIPs), and the revenue uplift after tier changes. Ensuring that AI correctly identifies a VIP across channels (linking back to omni-ID) means a Platinum member in-store gets the same recognition as online.
	•	**Gamification and Engagement Analytics:** AI can power gamified loyalty experiences – for example, personalized challenges (“Spend $100 this month to get a bonus reward”) that are tuned to each customer’s habits using predictive models. It can also figure out the optimal “spend $X get Y points” promotions for each person to maximize engagement without giving away margin unnecessarily. The Eagle Eye/Forrester report on personalized loyalty highlights using **loyalty-integrated gamification** – e.g., **Carrefour** has employed gamified campaigns in its app to engage customers beyond transactions . AI ensures these games or challenges are relevant (no point pushing a meat promo challenge to a vegetarian). **KPIs:** Participation rate in challenges, increase in average order value or frequency due to gamified campaigns, and social shares or referrals if the program encourages those (some advanced loyalty programs incentivize referring friends, where AI identifies likely advocates to target).
	•	**Loyalty Program Operations and Fraud** (overlap with fraud section): Ensuring the integrity of the program by detecting fraud (already covered) and optimizing liability (unused points). AI can forecast how much of issued loyalty currency will be redeemed (“breakage”) and help finance teams set aside appropriate reserves. This ensures leadership has clear visibility on the financial performance of loyalty initiatives (e.g., points redemption patterns impacting sales).

From a **leadership perspective**, loyalty programs often represent a significant investment, and AI provides the tools to maximize ROI from that investment. Leaders will watch metrics like **loyalty member share of total sales** (which should grow if the program is working well) and margin impact (ensuring the cost of rewards is justified by incremental revenue). AI allows for fine-tuning – giving just enough incentive to influence behavior without eroding margins. Over time, AI can even help restructure the program based on what members value (maybe the model finds that free shipping rewards drive more loyalty than discounts, guiding a strategic shift).

A success story is Amazon Prime (a paid membership model rather than points, but similar retention goals). Amazon uses extensive AI to personalize the Prime experience (from content on Prime Video to product recommendations with Prime pricing). As a result, **Prime members (about 75% of US households) spend over 4x as much as non-members over their lifetimes**  . While Prime’s value prop isn’t just AI, the principle of **integrated data and personalized perks** is shared with loyalty programs, showing how powerful membership models can be when enhanced with technology. Walmart might consider how AI could bolster its own membership offerings (like encouraging adoption of a Walmart-branded credit card or a potential subscription program) by targeting the right customers with the right incentives.

**Collaboration across teams:** Loyalty data with AI insights benefits marketing (for targeting campaigns), merchandising (knowing what loyal customers buy to plan assortment), and even suppliers (some retailers share loyalty insights with CPG brands to co-create tailored offers). The PC Optimum program at Loblaw demonstrates cross-team success; it combines grocery, pharmacy, and even wellness (PC Health app) data. By using AI to integrate health and shopping habits, they reward members for healthy behaviors, which in turn drives pharmacy engagement . This shows creative cross-domain use of loyalty data (health + retail) made possible by AI’s ability to crunch multiple data sources and find valuable correlations.

**Generative AI** in loyalty can also help with content – writing all those individualized offers or even creating virtual customer service agents to handle loyalty inquiries (e.g., “How many points do I have and what can I get with them?” could be answered by a chatbot). It ensures communications stay fresh and relevant to each member without a huge team of copywriters.

In terms of **benchmarks**: Personalization leader **Sephora** (not a grocery but retail) uses AI in its Beauty Insider loyalty program to tailor product recommendations and saw increased member spend and retention as a result . **Carrefour** and **Tesco** in the grocery space have likewise reported improved engagement metrics after investing in AI-driven loyalty personalization . As mentioned, Loblaw’s program growth of 11% QoQ in premium tier  and 16+ million engaged members is a testament to how AI can supercharge an already large program.

In conclusion, AI makes loyalty programs *dynamic* – each member can effectively have a unique experience that maximizes their value to both the customer and the company. **KPIs to track** include membership growth, active rate (active members as % of total), frequency and spend lift among members vs non-members, redemption rates of tailored offers, and overall program ROI (incremental margin vs cost of rewards). By continuously analyzing these, AI algorithms can even self-adjust strategies (e.g., stopping offers that don’t perform, scaling up ones that do, in a test-and-learn cycle). This creates a virtuous loop of improvement, keeping the loyalty program effective and exciting for customers.

**9. Financial Services (Retail Banking, Credit, and Insurance Integration)**

Many large retailers offer financial services – such as branded credit cards, installment financing (buy-now-pay-later), money transfers, or even banking products (Walmart in some markets has explored bank accounts and insurance). AI and GenAI are crucial in this domain to manage risk, personalize financial offerings, and streamline customer service for financial products. Even if Walmart Canada’s current financial services are primarily through partnerships (e.g., a Walmart credit card by a bank), understanding AI’s role here is important for product managers interfacing with those services. Key AI use cases:
	•	**Credit Scoring and Underwriting:** Traditionally, banks use credit bureau scores and simple rules to decide approval for credit cards or loans. AI can incorporate a wider array of data (including shopping behavior, if permissible and relevant) to make more nuanced lending decisions. For a retailer’s credit card, AI models might consider customer loyalty data: a long-time, high-spending customer might be a better credit risk than their bare credit score indicates. Conversely, it can catch subtle signs of risk early. **Benefit:** potentially higher approval rates (expanding the customer base) while maintaining or even reducing default rates – essentially **improving the risk-reward tradeoff**. Some fintechs like **Zest AI** or **Taktile** provide AI-driven credit decisioning engines that have been shown to **broaden access to credit for underbanked groups while keeping defaults low** . **KPIs:** Approval rate, average risk score of approved population, portfolio default rate, and loss rate. One can also measure **speed** of approvals – AI can automate instant decisions that used to take days (important for customer experience; e.g., approving a customer at checkout for an installment pay plan in seconds).
	•	**Personalized Financial Product Offers:** Using AI, retailers can tailor what financial products or terms to offer each customer. For instance, if a customer frequently uses buy-now-pay-later on the website, maybe the AI flags them as a candidate for a Walmart credit card and triggers an in-app offer with pre-approval (subject to credit). Or, if a family shops often and spends on back-to-school, the retailer might partner with an insurer to offer an AI-identified need like life insurance or product protection plans to that segment. **KPIs:** Take-up rate of financial offers, cross-sell rate (e.g., what % of retail customers adopt the financial product), and incremental sales due to financing (customers buy more when given financing options). **Example:** Some retailers found that offering AI-targeted installment plans at checkout increased conversion for high-ticket items by a notable percentage, as the AI ensured those offers went to customers likely to use them (and likely to pay successfully). Another KPI is **activation and usage rate** of a retail credit card – AI can help onboard customers so they actually use the card (maybe via GenAI-driven onboarding emails that explain benefits tailored to what that customer values).
	•	**Customer Service AI for Financial Queries:** Financial services often entail complex questions – account balances, payment issues, disputes, etc. Generative AI can assist here by providing detailed explanations in simple language, acting almost like a financial advisor or support rep. For example, **Capital One’s Eno** and **Bank of America’s Erica** are AI assistants that help customers with banking through chat or text . A Walmart customer with a store credit card could similarly use an AI chatbot specifically trained on cardholder FAQs (“What’s my next payment due? Can I increase my credit limit?”) to get quick answers. **KPIs:** Containment rate of the financial chatbot, reduction in calls to the bank call center, and user satisfaction with support. Financial info must be handled carefully (accuracy and compliance are critical), but modern LLMs fine-tuned on banking data are making strides. This also ties back to the contact center – but specifically for financial products where accuracy and tone (reassuring, clear) are paramount. GenAI can also create summary explanations of complex terms (like APR, fees) making them easier for customers to understand (benefiting financial literacy and trust).
	•	**Fraud and Security in Financial Services:** This overlaps with section 7, but specifically, AI helps prevent credit card fraud and identity theft in applications. Retailers’ financial arms typically rely on advanced fraud models (often provided by the card issuer or network). For instance, AI can verify an online credit card application by cross-referencing public records and detecting if it’s synthetic identity fraud. Walmart’s partner banks likely use such AI, and Walmart itself invests in secure tech (e.g., chip/PIN, transaction monitoring in their app) – all of which are enhanced by AI behind the scenes. **KPIs:** Application fraud attempts blocked, reduction in fraudulent transactions on the store card, etc., as detailed earlier.
	•	**Financial Planning and Budgeting Tools for Customers:** As a value-add, some retailers or their banking partners offer AI-driven insights to customers about their spending. For example, RBC’s **NOMI** digital assistant in Canada analyzes a customer’s transactions (across accounts) to provide insights and even automatically set aside money in savings. It was reported that RBC clients using NOMI “Find & Save” collectively put aside over **$3.6 billion in savings**, an outcome of AI analyzing cash flows and identifying safe-to-save amounts . For a retailer’s perspective, while that example is from a bank, similar AI could help a Walmart credit card customer manage their payments or offer insights like “You saved $X with Rollback deals last month” – these deepen engagement and loyalty by providing informational value, not just transactional. **KPIs:** Customer engagement with these tools (logins, interactions), financial health indicators (maybe a proprietary index of customer financial well-being), and secondary effects like lower delinquency rates (if AI budgeting tools help customers avoid missed payments).

For **leadership**, entering or expanding financial services can diversify revenue and increase customer lock-in. AI ensures this is done wisely – by managing credit risk, automating compliance checks (like anti-money laundering alerts on money services), and customizing offerings to maximize uptake. A critical metric at the executive level is often **incremental sales and profit due to financial services** (e.g., sales financed by the store card, interest income from the card, etc.). AI’s contribution might be indirect but crucial – e.g., lower loss rates mean the program is more profitable, or higher approval means more customers can buy big-ticket items.

**Collaboration:** The financial services arm (or partner) must work closely with the retail side to share data under proper privacy agreements. AI can help generate aggregated insights without breaching individual privacy – for instance, telling the retail side “Group X has high credit utilization, consider targeting budget-friendly products to them” without exposing personal data.

**Customer-facing benefit:** When done right, AI in retail financial services can **empower customers financially**. Quick credit decisions, personalized advice, and responsive support contribute to a positive experience. And trust is key – mishandling this space can damage brand trust more than maybe any other, so AI models are rigorously tested for fairness and bias (to avoid discriminatory lending) and explainability (so that adverse decisions can be explained to regulators and customers). The use of AI should comply with financial regulations, which in Canada are stringent, so often AI outputs are monitored by human credit officers or compliance staff (augmented intelligence rather than fully automated in some cases).

**Benchmark example:** One large bank reported that deploying an AI underwriting model led to a **approving 20% more applicants with the same risk level**, thus expanding their customer base without increasing defaults . While that’s banking, a retailer’s card or financing product could see similar benefits. Another example: Citibank’s use of ML slashed phishing attacks by 70% , which shows AI’s power in protecting financial customers from fraud (relevant if Walmart offers digital wallets or money transfer, etc.).

In summary, AI in retail financial services spans risk management, personalization, and customer service. **KPIs to monitor** include approval rates (and demographic fairness of those approvals), financial product penetration among customers, portfolio performance (loss rates, late payment rates – hopefully improved by AI-driven customer engagement), and customer satisfaction specific to financial offerings (e.g., a satisfaction score for the credit card experience). Walmart Canada’s leaders would coordinate with their financial partners to ensure these AI tools are being leveraged and that data from retail operations is feeding into better financial products for customers, closing the loop in the omnichannel ecosystem.

**Conclusion**

Across each of these nine functional areas, AI and Generative AI are powerful enablers of efficiency, insight, and innovation for a national omnichannel retailer like Walmart Canada. A common thread is **personalization and smarter decision-making at scale** – whether it’s marketing content tuned to each customer, customer service that instantly adapts to the individual’s context, or fraud systems that differentiate good vs bad behavior in milliseconds. By leveraging AI/GenAI, individual team members can offload repetitive tasks and focus on creative, strategic work; cross-functional collaboration improves as AI provides a “single source of truth” or seamless hand-offs between departments; leadership gains real-time visibility into operations and customer sentiment; deeper customer insights emerge from the data; operational data analysis becomes faster and more predictive; customer-facing digital products become more engaging and intuitive; and internal tools empower staff to deliver better results.

Real-world examples from leading retailers and platforms underscore the potential gains: from **20%+ conversion lifts in AI-personalized campaigns , to 30-40% faster call handling with AI assistance , to significant fraud loss reductions , and double-digit loyalty growth .** Industry benchmarks and early pilots suggest that when scaled, these improvements translate into stronger financial performance – for instance, generative AI could unlock 1.2 to 1.9 percentage points of margin improvement in retail according to McKinsey .

It’s important to note that success with AI/GenAI is not just about technology, but also about change management: training staff to work alongside AI, updating KPIs and dashboards to include AI-driven metrics, and continuously monitoring AI outputs for fairness, accuracy, and relevance. Walmart Canada’s leaders should ensure governance and ethical considerations are in place (e.g., transparent customer data practices, avoiding AI biases, and safeguarding data security) as they implement these solutions.

Fortunately, many tools and platforms are available – from big tech offerings (Google Cloud AI, Azure, AWS, Salesforce Einstein, etc.) to specialized retail AI startups – and can often be integrated with existing systems. Quick wins can be achieved by starting with areas that require fewer resources (for example, deploying an off-the-shelf AI chatbot is relatively fast, as noted by McKinsey , versus building a custom AI supply chain system). Each function discussed can begin with pilot projects to demonstrate KPI improvements, which then build the case for wider rollout.

By tracking the recommended KPIs for each use case, Walmart Canada can measure the impact on both customer experience and operational efficiency. For instance, an uptick in NPS after chatbot introduction, or a reduction in fraud losses after a new AI model, directly validates the investment. The white paper’s detailed breakdown can serve as a roadmap: prioritize areas with high ROI and direct customer impact (e.g., Marketing and Customer Experience), ensure the foundational data (Omni Customer ID) is solid, and then expand into more advanced or internal areas (like AI for merchants or finance) with the learnings in hand.

In conclusion, AI and Generative AI are not futuristic add-ons, but current, practical tools that **Walmart Canada’s product management and business teams can harness today**. By doing so, they will drive efficiency gains, create more cohesive omni-channel customer journeys, and unlock growth opportunities in an increasingly competitive retail landscape. The companies that successfully integrate AI into their DNA are likely to lead in market share and customer loyalty – positioning Walmart Canada to continue being a leader in retail innovation.
