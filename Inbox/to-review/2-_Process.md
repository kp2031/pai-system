Intro video of someone credible introducing the concept of building strong relationships and how consistent and frequent communications is key to deep, long lasting relationships

Introduce the simple model of identifying tier 0, 1 and 2 relationships - desired state

Short motivation on why I'm so interested in using this tool for myself - to stay on top of what matters to me the most and not allow the ever present distractions in a busy life and career to allow myself to forget to make those quick phone calls or emails...

Please select the people you consider to be very close to you (Tier 0 -- 1-5 people -- call for 30min, 3+ times a week)

Please select the people you consider to be close to you and that you would be happy if you communicated with them once a week or every other week (Tier 1 -- 10-20 people -- contact on a minimum twice a month basis)

Select all the people that you care about, but are fine with a once a year to two times a year reach-out just to see how they're doing  (Tier 2 -- up to 100 people) 

Advanced settings - only if you want... Otherwise the system will make assumptions 

what types of communications methods do you prefer?

Phone, email, text, Facebook or other _____

Can get specific by person... Eg one call one email per week
