# Bunk bed mattress research

**Summary**

For the Max & Lily Twin-Over-Full Bunk Bed with Stairs and Trundle, you’ll need two Twin mattresses (one for the top bunk and one for the trundle) and one Full mattress (for the bottom bunk). Max & Lily recommends 5″-thick standard mattresses—never exceeding 8″—for the Twin and Full bunks, and a Twin trundle mattress no more than 5″ thick   . In Canada, standard Twin mattresses measure 38″ × 75″ while Full (Double) mattresses measure 53″ × 75″   . Below are Canadian-available mattress options in the correct sizes and ideal thicknesses.
