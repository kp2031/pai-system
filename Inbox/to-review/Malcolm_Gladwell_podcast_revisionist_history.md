Malcolm Gladwell podcast revisionist history
Nothing of consequence gets accomplished without courage

Thresholds – the bar that has to be crossed for someone to get engaged in an activity

Weak link versus strong link – the ripple effect of an activity on other activities versus no effect on other activities – Basketball versus soccer – basketball having one superstar is more important than improving your weakest player versus in soccer you want to have the strongest weakest player because it relies on 8 to 10 good passes before a point be scored

Generous orthodoxy
