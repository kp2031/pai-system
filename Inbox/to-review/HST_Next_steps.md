HST Next steps

Apple's Requirement:
  Apple requires all Canadian developers to provide a GST/HST number, regardless of revenue. This is their policy even
  though you're below the $30,000 threshold.

  Your Options:

  1. Voluntary GST/HST Registration (Recommended for App Store)
    - Use your existing Business Number and add a GST/HST program account (RT account)
    - Can be done online at canada.ca or by phone: 1-800-959-5525
    - Your GST/HST number will be your BN + "RT0001"
    - Free to register
  2. Benefits of Registering:
    - Meet Apple's requirements
    - Can claim Input Tax Credits (ITCs) on business expenses
    - Looks more professional
    - Already set up when you start earning
  3. Obligations Once Registered:
    - Must file GST/HST returns (can be annual if revenue under $1.5M)
    - Can file nil returns if no sales
    - Must collect HST if selling outside App Store

  Since you already have a BN: You just need to add the GST/HST program account to your existing Business Number. This is
  much simpler than starting from scratch - it's just adding a program to your existing account.
