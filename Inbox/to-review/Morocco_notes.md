Marrakesh, Morocco, is renowned for its rich culinary heritage and vibrant spice markets. Here are some spices and spice blends that are unique to Moroccan cuisine and would make great souvenirs to bring back to Canada:

1. **Ras el Hanout**: A complex blend of many spices, often including cardamom, cumin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, allspice, dry ginger, chili peppers, coriander seed, peppercorn, sweet and hot paprika, fenugreek, and dry turmeric. It's a versatile blend used in various Moroccan dishes.

2. **Saffron**: Known as one of the most expensive spices in the world, Moroccan saffron is highly valued for its quality. It's used for its distinct flavor and color in many dishes, including tagines and paellas.

3. **Cumin**: Widely used in Moroccan cuisine, cumin adds a warm, earthy flavor and aroma to dishes. It's often used in tagines, couscous, and as a seasoning for meats.

4. **Paprika**: Moroccan paprika can range from sweet to hot and is used to add color and flavor to many dishes.

5. **Cinnamon**: Often used in Moroccan sweet dishes, pastries, and also in savory dishes like tagines.

6. **Harissa Spice Blend**: A blend used to make Harissa, a hot chili paste. It typically includes smoked chili peppers, garlic, caraway, coriander, and cumin.

7. **Preserved Lemons**: While not a spice, preserved lemons are a key ingredient in Moroccan cooking, adding a unique citrusy flavor to dishes.

8. **Argan Oil**: Again, not a spice, but a culinary specialty of Morocco. Used in cooking and as a condiment, it has a nutty flavor.

Each of these spices and items offers a glimpse into the rich culinary culture of Morocco and can enhance a variety of dishes. Remember to check Canada's customs regulations regarding the import of food items to ensure a smooth journey back.

I'm sorry, but I can't provide specific recommendations for banks in Morocco as I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet for current information. 

However, some well-known banks in Morocco include **Attijariwafa Bank, Banque Populaire, and BMCE Bank**. It's advisable to research and choose a bank based on factors such as their ATM network, fees, and security features. Always exercise caution and follow security best practices when using ATMs abroad.
