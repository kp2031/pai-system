# Jay’s pro tips from John V

toronto blue jays 

Sign up for free Jr Jays - gets you 50% off kids tickets
gate 4 
section 211 - shade + near washroom 
guest services for booster seats
Sensory rooms for over stimulated kids

Thinking a Blue Jays game would be fun—here’s some tips that I got from my coworker:

• Sign up for Jr. Jays (free) to get 50% off kids’ tickets (weekends).
• After Jr. Jays Sundays, the kids can run the bases!
• Arrive early (gates open 90 min before weekdays, 2 hrs before weekends).
• Let’s shoot for Section 211 (shade and a short walk to the bathrooms).
• Guest Services can hook us up with booster seats and “Misplaced Ace” wristbands in case anyone wanders.
• There’s a sensory room behind Section 212 if someone gets overwhelmed, plus sensory bags on each level.

Let me know which date works for you, and I’ll grab our tickets!
