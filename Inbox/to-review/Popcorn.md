# Popcorn

Put 1/3 cup into container and pop for ~2min 10sec - but varries based on microwave 

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a container that can be used to pour over popcorn in the microwave for about 35 to 45 seconds

Evenly spread (drop onto popcorn from 1ft above popcorn to reduce chances of lots of salt in one area)  1/16 - 1/8 teaspoon of Flavacol salt

Toss generously
