# Prompt to make a waterfall chart

**Example Prompt:** "Create a **waterfall chart** from the uploaded file. The chart should start with the 'Initial Revenue,' show the positive changes from 'New Sales' and 'Services,' the negative change from 'Refunds,' and end with the 'Final Net Revenue.' Please use green for increases and red for decreases."
Gemini will analyze the sequential positive and negative values in your data to construct the chart, which is excellent for visualizing the cumulative effect of sequential changes, like tracking profit or inventory.
