# Distribution calculation

Distribution amount / average share price = how much of my capital will be returned to you via that distribution 

Can you tell me how much the next 4 distribution amounts will be and what their average price is so I can understand how much capital will be returned via that distribution for the following ETFs - QDTE for 3202 units, ULTY for 4700 units, MSTE.TO for 420 units?
