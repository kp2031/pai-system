# Annie lebowiz prompt

Please reformat this photo while keeping the people on the photo look exactly like they are. 

Begin with soft, diffused lighting—if not captured in-camera, simulate it by gently lowering contrast and using radial filters or gradient masks to brighten the subject’s face subtly while keeping shadows present to retain mood. Apply warm temperature tones with a slightly golden tint, leaning into yellow and amber highlights to add intimacy and softness, often reminiscent of natural window light or late afternoon glow. Increase the temperature slider slightly, add gentle split toning with warm hues in the highlights and a touch of desaturated teal in the shadows for tonal depth.

Composes the portrait with environmental storytelling, so avoid blurring or removing the background—enhance it instead. Use the brush tool to selectively increase exposure and clarity on key props or surroundings that define the character of the subject (a piano, a dressing room, a bookshelf), but decrease saturation slightly to keep the focus on the person. The subject’s skin should remain natural—reduce texture and clarity slightly using masking tools, but do not over-soften. Maintain facial lines and details to preserve realism and depth.

Favors muted color palettes that lean cinematic. Reduce vibrance slightly and carefully lower blacks to flatten the dynamic range without losing important shadow information. You can also use curves in the tone curve panel to lift shadows and slightly lower highlights, creating a matte, painterly look.

Consider adding a very subtle vignette, using a feathered elliptical mask to darken edges gently and draw attention toward the center. Retouch with purpose: clean up distracting elements, but avoid perfecting skin or symmetry too much, embrace authenticity. For finishing, add a slight grain to emulate her film roots, and use lens blur sparingly if you want to simulate the medium format look, keeping the focus on the subject’s eyes while letting edges soften slightly.

Overall, the goal is to create an image that feels thoughtful, intimate, and cinematic, where the setting, posture, and light all reveal something deeper about the subject’s personality or story.
