Priyankaisms 

April 7, 2017 @ pretty ugly bar
"I wouldn't punch you in public"
"Stop making me do what you want, okay!"

“Listen, I’m smart now ok, so I must have done it for a reason!”

“I will find a feather and cut you!”

“I’m just letting you know as a courtesy”

“You haven’t seen me in two days, so you have to listen to me now!”

“I ain’t no basic bitc#, so I don’t want no basic bitc# stuff!”

“I’m still sleeping with my eyes open, so write it down and put a pin in it.”

“Dum dum dittaay”

Kavi: “we go half half on a veggie dog”
Pri: “no, full full”

Kavi makes a bad joke to waiter,
Priyanka turns to Kavi and says,
“I have to laugh so it’s not...”

Priyanka:
“You want me to check how late the donut place is open”
Kavi: 
“no”
Pri: 
“Well I’m checking already”

“For $10 for two coffees, they should really have a f#ckin barista”

“I know you think I’m crazy, but love me for me” - as we rush to get a cabana so we can relax later

“You can’t escape me” — when speaking about Niam trying to not talk to her 

“Show me how you shine” - when wanting me to do the dishes 

“it’s your choice if you make me choose violence“ when thinking I was going to turn the lights on at 11pm

“You’re smart eh!! Now I can say that because I’m a Canadian”

Kavi: “Is that gentle discipline?”
Pri: “No it’s not, I’ve had it with gentle discipline”

“I ain't never slacking on my Pimpin”
