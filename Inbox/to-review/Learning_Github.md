üìö Git/GitHub Tutorial: Understanding What We Did

  Step 1: Understanding Your Current Position

  Let's first see where we are:

‚è∫ Bash(git branch --show-current)
  ‚éø ¬†consolidation/planning-docs-mece

‚è∫ Bash(git branch -a | head -10)
  ‚éø ¬†  backup/pre-apple-intelligence
     * consolidation/planning-docs-mece
       development
     ‚Ä¶ +7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ What this means:
  - You're currently on consolidation/planning-docs-mece branch (the * shows current)
  - This branch contains our consolidated planning files
  - main branch is unchanged (safe!)

  Step 2: Understanding What We Changed

  Let's see what files we modified:

‚è∫ Bash(git log --oneline -3)
  ‚éø ¬†7ef212a consolidation: Restructure 32 planning docs into 5 MECE files
     2d416e1 Fix EventHistoryView recordings display and improve UI
     55705d8 Replace EventsListView with EventLibraryView for classic Library UI

‚è∫ Our consolidation commit is at the top! Let's see exactly what changed:

‚è∫ Bash(git diff --stat main..HEAD | head -15)
  ‚éø ¬† CLAUDE.md                                          |  303 ++++
      plans/BUSINESS.md                                  |  840 ++++++++++
      plans/DESIGN.md                                    |  765 ++++++++++
     ‚Ä¶ +12 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Step 3: Understanding Branches (What We Did)

  What is a branch?
  Think of it like making a copy of your project to experiment safely:

  main branch:     A --- B --- C  (safe, unchanged)
                                \
  our new branch:                D (our consolidation changes)

  Let me show you the difference:

‚è∫ Bash(echo "=== Files in MAIN branch ===" && git ls-tree main --name-only plans/ | head -5 && echo "" && echo "=== Files in
      OUR branch ===" && git ls-tree HEAD --name‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†=== Files in MAIN branch ===

     === Files in OUR branch ===
     ‚Ä¶ +6 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Main branch has NO plans folder yet, but our branch has the new structure!

‚è∫ Step 4: Review Your Changes (Before Merging)

  Let's review what you're about to merge:

‚è∫ Bash(echo "=== New Consolidated Files ===" && ls -lh plans/*.md && echo "" && echo "=== Archived Original Files ===" && ls
      plans/archive/ | wc -l && echo "files arch‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†Error: ls: glob: No such file or directory

     === New Consolidated Files ===

‚è∫ Bash(ls -lh plans/B*.md plans/D*.md plans/E*.md plans/P*.md plans/T*.md 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $9, $5}')
  ‚éø ¬†(No content)

‚è∫ Bash(ls -la plans/ | grep "\.md")
  ‚éø ¬†-rw-r--r--@  1 kavi  staff  28364 Sep 13 07:59 BUSINESS.md
     -rw-r--r--@  1 kavi  staff  24402 Sep 13 07:53 DESIGN.md
     -rw-r--r--@  1 kavi  staff  22177 Sep 13 07:56 EXECUTION.md
     ‚Ä¶ +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Perfect! You can see we have 5 clean files instead of 32.

‚è∫ Step 5: Create and Merge Pull Request (Your Next Steps)

  Now we need to merge your changes into the main branch. We'll use GitHub CLI (gh) to do everything from terminal:

‚è∫ Bash(gh pr create --title "Consolidate 32 planning docs into 5 MECE files" --body "## Summary
      - Consolidated 32 scattered planning documents into 5 well-organized ME‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†https://github.com/kp2031/RehearSmart/pull/11
     Warning: 30 uncommitted changes

‚è∫ Excellent! Your pull request is created: https://github.com/kp2031/RehearSmart/pull/11

  Now let's check its status:

‚è∫ Bash(gh pr status)
  ‚éø ¬†Relevant pull requests in kp2031/RehearSmart

     Current branch
     ‚Ä¶ +8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Step 6: Review and Merge the Pull Request

  Let's view the PR details:

‚è∫ Bash(gh pr view 11)
  ‚éø ¬†title:	Consolidate 32 planning docs into 5 MECE file
     state:	OPEN
     author:	kp2031
     ‚Ä¶ +38 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Now, when you're ready to merge (after reviewing), you can merge directly from terminal:

‚è∫ Bash(echo "To merge this PR, you would run: gh pr merge 11 --merge" && echo "" && echo "Options:" && echo "  --merge:
      Creates a merge commit (recommended)" && echo "‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†To merge this PR, you would run: gh pr merge 11 --merge

     Options:
     ‚Ä¶ +3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ üìñ Git/GitHub Learning Summary

  What We Did:

  1. Created a branch - A safe copy to make changes without affecting main
  2. Made changes - Consolidated files and updated documentation
  3. Committed changes - Saved our work with a descriptive message
  4. Pushed to GitHub - Uploaded our branch to GitHub
  5. Created a Pull Request - Asked to merge our changes into main

  Your Next Steps:

  Option A: Merge Now (if you're happy with changes)

  # Merge the PR
  gh pr merge 11 --merge

  # Then switch back to main and pull updates
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main

  # Delete the branch locally
  git branch -d consolidation/planning-docs-mece

  Option B: Review First (recommended)

  # View the changes in detail
  gh pr diff 11

  # Or open in browser to review
  gh pr view 11 --web

  # Then merge when ready
  gh pr merge 11 --merge

  Helpful Git Commands to Remember:

  # See what branch you're on
  git branch --show-current

  # See all branches
  git branch -a

  # Check status of files
  git status

  # See commit history
  git log --oneline -10

  # Switch branches
  git checkout [branch-name]

  # Create new branch
  git checkout -b [new-branch-name]

  # See differences
  git diff main..HEAD

  # Pull latest changes
  git pull origin main

  Understanding the GitHub Flow:

  1. Branch - Make changes in isolation
  2. Commit - Save your changes
  3. Push - Upload to GitHub
  4. PR (Pull Request) - Request to merge
  5. Review - Check changes are good
  6. Merge - Combine into main
  7. Delete branch - Clean up

  Would you like me to help you merge the PR now, or would you prefer to review it first?
