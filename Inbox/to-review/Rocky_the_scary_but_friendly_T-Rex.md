# Rocky the scary but friendly T-Rex

Rocky the scary but friendly T-Rex 

Once... upon... a time… in a big… green… jungle… there lived… a dinosaur. But not just any dinosaur. His name… was Rocky… and he was a **T-Rex**. A T-Rex is the biggest… and the strongest… dinosaur of them all.

When Rocky walked… the ground… would shake. *BOOM... BOOM... BOOM...* (stomp, stomp, stomp) That sound… is Rocky’s footsteps. Every time… he took a step… the trees would wiggle… and shake. The little dinosaurs… would stop… what they were doing… and listen. *What’s that sound?* they would wonder.

Rocky had very… big… teeth. Sharp… like this! *Chomp… chomp!* (biting sound) And when Rocky… growled… it sounded like this: *ROOOAAARRR!* (roaring sound) All the dinosaurs… in the jungle… would say, *"Oh no… here comes… Rocky!"* because… they knew… he was… a little bit scary.

But guess what? Rocky… wasn’t just scary. No, no! He was also… a little bit… friendly. How can that be? Let’s find out.

One day… Rocky was walking… through the jungle… *STOMP… STOMP… STOMP*… (stomp, stomp, stomp) when he heard… a tiny, tiny sound. *"Help! Help!"* it cried. Rocky… stopped… in his tracks. He turned… his big head… *creeeeeak*… (creaking sound) and looked around. First, he looked… this way… *shooo*… (whooshing sound) and then he looked… that way… *shooo*... until finally… he saw it.

There… stuck… in the mud… was a little… triceratops. The triceratops… was wriggling… and squirming… trying to get free… but the mud… was too… sticky. *"Help me! Help me, please!"* the triceratops… called out.

Rocky… looked at the poor… little… triceratops. His big eyes… were scared… and his tiny… legs… were stuck. The other dinosaurs… were too afraid… to help… because they didn’t… want to get stuck… too. But not… Rocky!

Rocky took… a deep breath… *huuuuuuuh*… (deep breath sound) and let out… a BIG… roar! *ROOOAAARRR!* (roaring sound) The other dinosaurs… gasped… *Gasp!* (gasping sound) They thought… Rocky… might be angry… but no! Rocky… was going… to help.

He walked… over… to the muddy spot… *STOMP… STOMP… STOMP*… (stomp, stomp, stomp) closer… and closer… The little triceratops… looked up… at Rocky. His eyes… were big… and he was shaking… just a little… because, after all… Rocky… was a T-Rex.

But Rocky… didn’t want… to hurt him. Oh no! Rocky… leaned down… very… slowly… and with his big… strong… nose… he gave the triceratops… a gentle… push. The triceratops… wiggled… and wiggled… and then… *POP!* (popping sound) Out of the mud… he came!

The little triceratops… was so… happy! He jumped… up and down—*Boing… boing!*— (bouncing sound) and said, *"Thank you… Rocky! You… saved me!"* But he was still… a tiny bit… scared… because, well… Rocky… was still… a T-Rex.

Rocky… looked down… at the little… dinosaur… and gave… a small… growl—*grrrrr!*—(growling sound) just to remind… everyone… that he could be… scary… if he needed to be. But then… he turned around… his big tail… swishing like… *swish… swish… swish*… (swishing sound) and he walked away… back into the jungle. *BOOM… BOOM… BOOM*—(stomping sound) Rocky… the T-Rex… off on another… adventure.

The other dinosaurs… peeked out… from their hiding spots… their eyes… big… and round. They whispered, *"Did you… see that? Rocky… saved the triceratops! Maybe… he’s not… so scary… after all… but he’s still… a little bit… scary… and that’s… okay!"*

And that… my friend… is the story… of Rocky… the T-Rex… who was… a little bit… scary… but also… a little bit… friendly. And he lived… happily ever after… in the big… green… jungle.

The end… *TA-DA!*
