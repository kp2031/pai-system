We will focus on three core initiatives: enhancing the Help Center’s knowledge base with AI-driven content recommendations aligned with proven practices from Walmart U.S., refining the chatbot and voice bot capabilities to mirror the success metrics achieved in the U.S. market, and upgrading the contact center agent tools with functionalities already validated by our global counterparts. Each initiative will be tracked through key performance indicators, such as reducing average handling time by X% and increasing customer self-service resolution rates by Y%, ensuring we leverage proven successes from Walmart U.S.

**Expected Outcomes and Long-Term Goals**

By executing this strategy, we anticipate significant improvements in customer satisfaction scores and operational efficiency, aligned with the benchmarks set by Walmart U.S. Our long-term goal is to achieve a customer satisfaction score of X% and reduce operational costs by Y% within the next three years.
