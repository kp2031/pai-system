# App Store readiness

i just wanted you to make a plan, no code at this stage. can you please review all the code in the app to make sure it's ready for the apple app store submission? does it have everything in it that i need to ask users to pay for a monthly or annual subscription? can you create a app_store_readiness.md file with all the info I need. take your time and search the web for best practices. No coding only planning
