Gummy recipe
![Gummy recipe](images/Gummy%20recipe.jpeg)

 Ingredients
100ml-250ml Magical Tincture (to be reduced to MBO in step 4, below)
2 x 85g packages of flavored gelatin (jello) of your choice
70g (5 envelopes of 7g each) unflavored gelatin
1/2 tablespoon Tart & Sour or citric acid powder
118ml (1/2 cup) cold fruit juice of your choice (no high-citrus juices, no pineapple, no orange, no kiwi)
30ml of honey or agave nectar
3/4 teaspoon flavor extract

 How To

1. In a large, non-stick sauté pan on low heat, reduce your tincture by making slow circular motions with the pan until almost all the alcohol has evaporated, creating concentrated canna-oil, texture like molasses (about 10min on Low #2 setting on stove) then remove pan from burner and let cool for 20 min to room temperature
2. Stir agave together with the chilled fruit juice and flavor extract and refrigerate until needed (3 min)
3. In a large bowl, whisk all the gelatins and citric acid together (3 min)
4. In room temperature canna-oil pan, pour cold juice/agave/flavor mixture
5. Slowly add dry ingredients into the cold liquid in the pan and thoroughly whisk for 5-10 min until mixture is dissolved
6. Let the mixture bloom for 20min
7. While mixture is blooming, place gummy-molds onto a parchment sheet covered hard flat pan and lightly spray silicone molds and condiment container with coconut oil (3 min)
8. After 20 min, turn another burner to low-medium (#3 on stove) and place pan onto burner and start slowly whisking bloomed gelatin for 5-10min until fully mixed and liquified
9. Slowly pour the hot mixture into a 350ml condiment container (with a spout) and carefully and quickly pour mixture into molds
10. Place gummy molds into refrigerator for 60 min
11. (Optional) Make a mixture of gummy toppings into a very large bowl - Sugar, Citric acid, Tajin, baking soda to prevent sticking
12. Remove from refrigerator after 60 min and pop gummies into the large topping bowl and mix around until gummies are fully coated
13. Place all gummies onto a parchment-sheet covered pan to dehydrate for 24-48hrs

	
Chef’s Tip: Magical Gummies must be kept refrigerated. In the freezer, they will keep for up to a year, in the refrigerator up to 2 months.
