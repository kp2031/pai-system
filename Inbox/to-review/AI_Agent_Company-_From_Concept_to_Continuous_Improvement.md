Slide 4: The Hidden Danger: Absence Blindness
 * Title: Absence Blindness: The Silent Saboteur
 * Definition: RAG fails to retrieve relevant info because it's not present in the knowledge base.
 * Consequences:
   * "I don't know" responses.
   * Hallucinations (making things up).
   * Erodes user trust and agent reliability.
 * Examples:
   * Agent can't find a specific product model if it's not in the database.
   * Legal agent fails on a new regulation not yet indexed.
Notes:
 * Course Material: Present case studies or hypothetical scenarios demonstrating RAG failures due to missing information.
 * Discussion Prompt: "How would you identify if your current AI tool (e.g., a custom GPT) is suffering from absence blindness?"
Slide 5: Introducing the Data Flywheel for AI Agents

   * Models learn to create better "embeddings" (numerical representations).
   * Distinguish between relevant and irrelevant data pairs.
   * Improves retrieval accuracy.
 * Data Augmentation:
   * Expand and diversify your training data.
   * Techniques:
     * Paraphrasing existing documents.
     * Generating synthetic Q&A pairs using LLMs.
     * Creating "negative examples" (irrelevant docs for a query).
Notes:
 * Course Material: Simple illustrations of how data pairs are used in contrastive learning. Examples of augmented data.
 * Emphasize that you don't need to implement these, but understand their purpose.
Slide 9: Data Preparation Strategies for Fine-tuning
 * Title: Preparing Your Data for Fine-tuning
 * Collection:
   * Gather domain-specific text, Q&A, documents.
   * Leverage existing internal knowledge bases.

Class 3: Specialized RAG - Diverse Queries and Multi-modal Data
Slide 11: The Challenge of Diverse Query Types
 * Title: One Size Does Not Fit All: Diverse Queries
 * Not all queries are simple factual questions:
   * Keyword searches (e.g., "product SKU 123").
   * Semantic searches (e.g., "how to fix a leaky faucet").
   * Structured data lookups (e.g., "what's the sales figure for Q3?").
   * Navigational queries (e.g., "take me to the contact page").
 * Limitation: A single, general search index often struggles.
Notes:
 * Course Material: Provide examples of different query types and how a simple RAG might fail.
Slide 12: Optimizing for Diverse Query Types
 * Title: Specialized Search Indices for Better Retrieval
 * Strategy: Use different types of indices for different data/query needs.
 * Types of Indices:
   * Vector Databases: For semantic similarity (text, image, audio embeddings). Best for "meaning-based" search.
   * Keyword Search Engines: For exact matches, names, codes (e.g., Elasticsearch, Lucene). Best for precise lookups.
   * Graph Databases: For highly interconnected data and relationship queries (e.g., social networks, knowledge graphs).
 * Hybrid Search: Combine multiple strategies for comprehensive results.
Notes:
 * Course Material: Diagrams illustrating different search index types and their applications.
 * Explain when to use each type, not how to build them from scratch.
Slide 13: Improving Multi-modal RAG
 * Title: Handling Complex Data: Multi-modal RAG
 * Challenge: Incorporating images, audio, video, structured data.
 * Techniques:
   * Multi-modal Embeddings: Represent different data types in a common vector space.
   * Cross-modal Retrieval: Query one modality (e.g., text) to retrieve from another (e.g., images).
   * Transcription/OCR: Convert audio/images to text for processing.
   * Metadata Extraction: Tagging non-text data with descriptive text.
 * Goal: Unified retrieval across all data types.
Notes:
 * Course Material: Illustrative scenarios of multi-modal RAG applications (e.g., "find images related to this text description," "answer questions based on text docs and product videos").
 * Discuss the challenges of data integration and synchronization.
Class 4: Agentic RAG - Smart Question Routing and Function Calls

Slide 16: Enhancing Search with Function Calls (Tool Use)
 * Title: Function Calls: Integrating External Tools
 * Concept: LLMs can be prompted to "call" specific external functions or APIs.
 * Examples of Tools:
   * Calculator for math.
   * Database query tool (e.g., for inventory).
   * Booking system.
   * Web search for real-time data.
   * Internal CRM API.
 * Design: Define clear "tool descriptions" for the LLM to understand.
Notes:
 * Course Material: Conceptual examples of LLM prompts demonstrating how to define and trigger function calls (similar to OpenAI's function calling feature).
 * Discussion Prompt: "Imagine your agent needs to check a product's availability in real-time and then answer a follow-up question about its features. How would you design the routing and function calls for this scenario?"
Slide 17: Orchestration of Complex Agent Workflows
 * Title: Orchestrating Agent Workflows
 * Goal: Handle multi-step user requests seamlessly.
 * Process: Chain together:
   * RAG queries.
   * Function calls.
   * LLM reasoning.
 * Example: User asks "What's the weather in Paris, and what's a good restaurant there?"
   * Agent uses weather API (function call).
   * Agent uses RAG on restaurant database.
   * Agent synthesizes answer.
Notes:
 * Course Material: More complex flowcharts showing multi-step agent interactions.
 * Highlight the "agentic loop" of observation, thought, action.
