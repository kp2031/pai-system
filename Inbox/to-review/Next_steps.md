# Next steps

Next steps
Company Purpose - why... we do... inspire 
Build apps that help people 

Company mission - what ...we do
We design practical apps for people that need help

Strategy - how ...we'll win 
By designing, building and launching mobile apps using core design thinking principles with a unwavering focus on helping people live better lives

We believe bad design is obvious and good design is invisible.

We believe that design is like a friend that helps you when you need it and not any more.

- Build a rough prototype of an app
- Make a basic site with rough images and copy (prototype 1)
- design a rough logo
