# 30-60-90 Day Onboarding & Execution Plan: Abhinav

**30-60-90 Day Onboarding & Execution Plan: Abhinav**
**
**
**Role:** Senior Manager, Product Management – Post Purchase Experience & Care 

**Vision:** To establish a world-class, user-centric product function that drives measurable improvements in the post-order and customer care experience, earning the confidence of stakeholders and empowering your team to execute with excellence.

**Phase 1: First 30 Days – Listen, Learn, and Assess**
*The primary goal is to absorb as much context as possible. Understand the people, platforms, processes, and politics. Focus on building relationships and diagnosing the current state before prescribing solutions.*

|  Category<br/> | Details<br/> |
|-----|-----|
|  **Key Objectives**<br/> | 1. **Establish Foundational Relationships:** Build trust with direct reports, your Director, and key cross-functional peers. <br> 2. **Master the Product Landscape:** Develop a deep understanding of the POX and Care product ecosystems, including user flows, technology stacks, and business logic. <br> 3. **Assess Team & Process Health:** Evaluate current team rituals, skill sets, backlogs, and delivery velocity.<br/> |
|  **Activities &<br>Focus Areas**<br/> | • **People:** Conduct 1:1s with your two direct reports to understand their roles, strengths, challenges, and career goals. Meet with your Director to align on expectations and success metrics. <br> • **Product Deep Dives:** Review product documentation, roadmaps, and PRDs for all key areas (Help Centre, Comms, Tracking, Order Tools, Chat/Voice Bots, Agent Tools). Sit with agents to observe them using the tools. Use the products as a customer would. <br> • **Stakeholder Immersion:** Schedule introductory meetings with leads in Engineering, UX, Analytics, CX Ops, and the CGO's office (Joseph). Focus on their priorities, pain points, and perception of the team. <br> • **Initiative Review:** Get briefed on all active projects: CCaaS 2.0 migration, voice bot launch, new Help Centre UX, order delay comms, and the escalated bugs from Joseph. Understand status, risks, and dependencies.<br/> |
|  **Expected<br>Deliverables**<br/> | • **Personal Onboarding Plan:** A list of all stakeholders to meet, systems to gain access to, and key documents to review. <br> • **Team Assessment Summary (Private):** Initial notes on team dynamics, individual strengths, and potential skill gaps. <br> • **"State of the Union" Outline:** A preliminary diagnosis of each product area, including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). Note initial quick-win hypotheses.<br/> |
|  **Stakeholders<br>to Engage**<br/> | • **Direct Reports & Director** <br> • **Peer Product Managers** <br> • **Engineering & UX Leads** <br> • **CX Operations & Customer Support Leadership** <br> • **Analytics Partners**<br/> |
|  **Potential<br>Watchouts**<br/> | • **Information Overload:** Prioritize learning; don't feel pressured to have all the answers immediately. <br> • **Inherited Biases:** Listen actively but form your own, data-backed opinions. <br> • **Pressure for Instant Action:** Resist the urge to make major changes. Use this time to build social and political capital.<br/> |
|  **Metrics of<br>Early Success**<br/> | • Positive feedback from initial 1:1s. <br> • Can articulate the core function and primary KPIs for each product in your portfolio. <br> • Have a clear calendar of recurring team and stakeholder meetings to attend.<br/> |

**Phase 2: Days 31-60 – Align, Strategize, and Identify Wins**
*The focus shifts from learning to formulating a point of view. Use your initial assessment to align stakeholders around a shared vision and identify high-impact, achievable initiatives.*

|  Category<br/> | Details<br/> |
|-----|-----|
|  **Key Objectives**<br/> | 1. **Develop a Cohesive Product Strategy:** Synthesize learnings into a clear, prioritized vision for POX and Care. <br> 2. **Secure Stakeholder Alignment:** Gain buy-in on key problems to solve and the proposed direction from your leadership and cross-functional partners. <br> 3. **Empower Your Team:** Begin coaching direct reports, refining team processes, and removing identified blockers.<br/> |
|  **Activities &<br>Focus Areas**<br/> | • **Strategic Synthesis:** Consolidate your "State of the Union" assessment into a formal strategy document. Frame problems using data (e.g., "We have a 15% escalation rate from chat because X, Y, Z"). <br> • **Roadmap Refinement:** Work with your team to review and pressure-test existing roadmaps against your new strategic framework. Deprioritize work that doesn't align. <br> • **Quick Win Execution:** Identify 1-2 small but highly visible initiatives (e.g., fixing the CGO-escalated bugs, a small UX tweak to the Help Centre) and guide them to completion. This builds credibility. <br> • **Prepare for Executive Reviews:** Begin outlining the narrative and data for the July MSM presentation and the deep dives with Joseph. What is the story you want to tell? <br> • **Process Improvement:** Introduce or refine one key team process (e.g., standardized PRD template, weekly backlog grooming with engineering).<br/> |
|  **Expected<br>Deliverables**<br/> | • **Draft Product Strategy V1:** A document outlining the vision, key problem statements, and prioritized strategic pillars for POX & Care for the next 6-12 months. <br> • **Revised Q3 Roadmap:** A clearly articulated and sequenced roadmap, socialized with key stakeholders. <br> • **MSM & CGO Presentation Outline:** A detailed storyboard and data plan for your upcoming executive presentations. <br> • **First "Quick Win" Shipped:** Tangible proof of the team's ability to deliver value under your leadership.<br/> |
|  **Stakeholders<br>to Engage**<br/> | • **Chief Growth Officer (Joseph)** <br> • **Director-Level Peers** <br> • **Finance & Legal Partners** <br> • **International Counterparts** <br> • **Customer Insights Team**<br/> |
|  **Potential<br>Watchouts**<br/> | • **Boiling the Ocean:** Focus on a few critical priorities rather than trying to fix everything at once. <br> • **Lack of Data:** If data is unavailable to support your strategy, make sourcing that data a key part of the roadmap. <br> • **Passive Alignment:** Ensure stakeholders are truly bought-in, not just nodding along. Document decisions and action items.<br/> |
|  **Metrics of<br>Early Success**<br/> | • Signed-off Q3 roadmap from your Director. <br> • Measurable impact from your first quick win (e.g., bug count reduced, a minor lift in a key metric). <br> • Your team can articulate the "why" behind their work.<br/> |

**
**
**Phase 3: Days 61-90 – Execute, Measure, and Iterate**
*This phase is about demonstrating sustained execution and establishing your operating rhythm for the long term. Focus on driving your strategic initiatives forward and building a culture of continuous improvement.*

|  Category<br/> | Details<br/> |
|-----|-----|
|  **Key Objectives**<br/> | 1. **Drive Flawless Execution:** Ensure your team is delivering on the Q3 roadmap with high quality and predictability. <br> 2. **Establish a Data-Driven Culture:** Embed experimentation and KPI-driven decision-making into the team's DNA. <br> 3. **Communicate Value:** Proactively and effectively communicate team progress, impact, and learnings to all levels of the organization.<br/> |
|  **Activities &<br>Focus Areas**<br/> | • **Executive Presentations:** Deliver compelling, data-rich presentations at the MSM and in deep dives with the CGO. Land your key messages and secure support for your future direction. <br> • **Run the Operating Rhythm:** Lead key rituals like monthly product reviews, quarterly planning, and stakeholder steering committees. <br> • **Launch & Learn:** Oversee the launch of a significant feature (e.g., the first phase of the new voice bot or Help Centre UX). Lead the post-launch analysis and iteration planning. <br> • **Scale Best Practices:** Continue rolling out process improvements and ensure they are adopted consistently by the team. <br> • **Develop Your People:** Finalize development plans for your direct reports, providing clear, actionable feedback and growth opportunities.<br/> |
|  **Expected<br>Deliverables**<br/> | • **Successful Executive Presentations:** Positive reception and clear next steps from the MSM and CGO meetings. <br> • **Q3 Progress Report & Q4 Outlook:** A data-driven summary of what the team accomplished and what's next. <br> • **Product KPI Dashboard:** A shared dashboard tracking the core health and success metrics for all products in your portfolio. <br> • **Team Development Plans:** Documented growth plans for each of your direct reports.<br/> |
|  **Stakeholders<br>to Engage**<br/> | • **CEO & Executive Leadership (via MSM)** <br> • **Your Full Cross-Functional Team** <br> • **Your Direct Reports (focus on development)**<br/> |
|  **Potential<br>Watchouts**<br/> | • **Losing Momentum:** The initial energy of being new will fade. Maintain discipline in your operating rhythm. <br> • **Ignoring Setbacks:** Not every launch will be a success. Foster a culture where failures are treated as learning opportunities. <br> • **Becoming Insular:** Don't let execution cause you to lose touch with customers or stakeholders. Keep external feedback loops open.<br/> |
|  **Metrics of<br>Early Success**<br/> | • Key product metrics (e.g., contact rate, self-service resolution, CSAT) are showing positive trends. <br> • Your team is recognized as a reliable, high-performing partner. <br> • You are sought out for your strategic opinion on digital experience matters.<br/> |
