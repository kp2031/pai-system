5 Practical Tips for Your AI Agent Creation Business (No Advanced Coding Required, Yet!)
Given your engineering background and willingness to learn with AI coding assistants, you're in a strong position to build an AI agent creation business. Here are five practical steps:
1. Focus on Niche Problem-Solving, Not General AI Magic
 * Insight Applied: Jason emphasizes that a "smarter AI" doesn't solve a "dumber team's" lack of problem definition. Your engineering mindset is perfect for this!
 * Actionable Tip: Instead of trying to build a general-purpose AI agent, identify very specific, narrow problems within a particular industry or for a particular type of user. For example, "AI agent for generating detailed construction material lists from blueprints" or "AI agent for drafting initial legal disclaimers for small e-commerce businesses." These specific problems will guide your tool selection and agent design.
 * How AI Assistants Help: Use your AI coding assistants (e.g., Claude, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot) to research existing tools, APIs, and data sources relevant to your chosen niche. They can help you understand how to integrate these tools, even if you're not writing the full code from scratch.
2. Master Prompt Engineering and Tool Definition
 * Insight Applied: An AI agent is an LLM with a "portfolio of tools." Your primary "coding" will initially be defining these tools and crafting effective prompts.
 * Actionable Tip: Dedicate significant time to learning prompt engineering best practices. This includes understanding how to instruct LLMs to use tools, handle outputs, and recover from errors. For each tool you envision, clearly define its purpose, inputs, and expected outputs. Think of these tool definitions as mini-API specifications.
 * How AI Assistants Help: Your AI assistants can help you generate and refine prompts for specific tasks, and even suggest how to structure tool definitions for various LLM frameworks (e.g., function calling in OpenAI). They can also help you write simple wrapper functions for external APIs that your agent will call.
3. Implement Granular Evaluation from Day One (Even Manually)
 * Insight Applied: Jason stresses the importance of topic analysis and granular evaluation to make agents reliable.
 * Actionable Tip: For your first few agent prototypes, don't just test if it "works." Create a simple spreadsheet or document where you categorize different types of user queries or agent tasks. For each category, define specific success criteria. Manually review the agent's responses for each category and assign a simple score (e.g., 1-5) or a pass/fail. This manual process will give you invaluable qualitative data and highlight areas for improvement.
 * How AI Assistants Help: While the initial evaluation might be manual, AI assistants can help you structure your evaluation criteria, generate diverse test cases for each category, and even draft summaries of agent performance based on your raw notes. As you learn more, they can help you write simple scripts to automate parts of this evaluation.
4. Prioritize Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and Rapid Iteration
 * Insight Applied: Jason's advice is clear: "build something quickly, start tracking that data."
 * Actionable Tip: Resist the urge to build a perfect, feature-rich agent from the start. Identify the absolute core functionality that solves your chosen niche problem. Build only that. Get it in front of a few test users (even friends or early adopters) as quickly as possible. Collect their feedback, observe how they use it, and then iterate based on real-world data and "weird things that happen."
 * How AI Assistants Help: This is where AI coding assistants shine. They can quickly generate boilerplate code, help you connect different components, and even suggest simple UI elements if your agent needs a basic interface. This significantly reduces the time from idea to a working prototype, allowing you to iterate much faster.
5. Cultivate a "Tool-Centric" Mindset for Growth
 * Insight Applied: The core idea is the "portfolio of tools" and the need to continually add, verify, and combine them.
 * Actionable Tip: Think of your business not just as "building AI agents," but as "building and managing a library of specialized AI tools." As you encounter new problems or needs, consider if a new tool (an API call, a specific data processing function, a custom script) can be added to your agent's capabilities. This mindset allows for modular growth and scalability.
 * How AI Assistants Help: Your AI assistants are your ultimate partners in this. When you identify a need for a new tool, describe its function, inputs, and outputs to your AI assistant. It can help you find relevant libraries, write the code for the tool, and even integrate it into your existing agent structure, significantly accelerating your ability to expand your agents' capabilities.
By following these steps, you can leverage your engineering aptitude and AI coding assistants to build a robust AI agent creation business, even without deep prior coding experience. Good luck!

Key Insights from the AI Agent Interview
The interview with Jason, a top AI consultant, provides valuable perspectives on building and deploying AI agents. His insights can be grouped into the following themes:
1. Defining and Understanding AI Agents
 * AI Agent as a "Tool Caller": Jason primarily defines an AI agent as an LLM (Large Language Model) with a "portfolio of tools." The core functionality is the LLM calling these tools within a loop.
 * Evolving Autonomy: He notes that the autonomous task execution length of AI (like GPT-4) is growing exponentially, suggesting that the "for loop" (iterative tool calling) might become less explicitly necessary as LLMs become more capable of extended tasks.
 * Portfolio of Tools: The emphasis is on building out and managing this "portfolio" of tools, including adding new ones, verifying their capabilities, and combining them for valuable outcomes.
2. Ensuring Reliability and Evaluation in Production
 * Topic Analysis/Clustering for Evals: A crucial practice for reliability is using "topic analysis" or clustering techniques to group conversations or agent interactions. This allows for more granular evaluation.
 * Granular Evaluation: Instead of a single, ambiguous overall score (e.g., "67 means what?"), breaking down evaluations by clusters (e.g., "questions about finances," "scheduling," "answers requiring tables") helps identify specific areas of weakness or strength.
 * Actionable Insights from Evals: Low scores in specific clusters immediately highlight problems to investigate. This leads to actionable steps: analyzing conversations, checking tools used, identifying missing context or tools, and then iterating to improve the agent.
 * Track Metrics and Group Data: The general advice is to set up evaluations from the start, track every possible metric, but most importantly, group data together to gain actionable insights.
3. Common Pitfalls and Mindset
 * "Smarter AI" Fallacy: A significant pitfall is the belief that the agent can and should "do anything" or "do everything." Jason jokes that the more a company thinks they need a "smarter AI," the "dumber the team is," implying a lack of clear problem definition.
 * Founder's Mindset: Great founders, in contrast, define specific, important tasks based on customer needs and expert observation. They then model out a pipeline for the AI, rather than expecting the AI to figure out the business problem itself.
 * Focus on Problem Definition: The core idea is that AI agents are solutions to well-defined problems, not a magic bullet to avoid thinking about customer needs or team operations.
4. Deployment and Productization
 * Prioritize Speed to Market (MVP): The most important thing is to "build something quickly," start tracking data, and then perform data analysis. Taking six months to build means six months before you can make better decisions based on real data.
 * Real-World Feedback is Key: The biggest improvements come from "weird things that happen" in production, like discovering multilingual problems after launch. Getting an MVP out quickly allows for collecting real feedback and iterating based on those unexpected challenges.
 * Productizing for Global Use: While not fully elaborated in the snippet, the implication is that productizing an agent for global use involves addressing real-world complexities like multilingual support and adapting UIs.
5. Mindset Shifts for Leaders
 * Understanding "I Have To": The initial mindset shift mentioned by Jason is "understanding that I have to," which implies a shift from just being a developer to taking on the responsibility and strategic thinking required for leadership in AI.
