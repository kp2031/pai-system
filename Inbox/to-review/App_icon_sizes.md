# App icon sizes

**Image Format and Requirements**

	â€¢	**Format**: PNG (.png)
	â€¢	**Background**: Must not be transparent (fill it with a solid color)
	â€¢	**Resolution**: No compression or resizing â€” Apple expects pixel-perfect assets.

You donâ€™t supply just one image; you provide **multiple sizes** for various devices. Common ones include:
|  **Size (pixels)**<br/> | **Purpose**<br/> |
|-----|-----|
|  20Ã—20<br/> | Notification (iPhone, iPad)<br/> |
|  29Ã—29<br/> | Settings, Spotlight<br/> |
|  40Ã—40<br/> | Spotlight<br/> |
|  60Ã—60<br/> | iPhone App<br/> |
|  76Ã—76<br/> | iPad App<br/> |
|  83.5Ã—83.5<br/> | iPad Pro<br/> |
|  1024Ã—1024<br/> | App Store Icon (required for App Store submission)<br/> |

**Where to Put App Icons in Xcode**

	â€¢	Use **Asset Catalog** (Assets.xcassets) to manage icons.
	â€¢	Inside this catalog, create or use the default **AppIcon** set:
	â€¢	Right-click inside Assets.xcassets â†’ New App Icon.
	â€¢	Xcode will create a slot-based interface showing where each size should go.

**Naming the Files:**

You **donâ€™t need to name them specifically** â€” just drag each image into the appropriate size slot. Xcode handles renaming internally.

ðŸŒ™** 3. Dark Mode vs. Light Mode Icons**

**App icons do not change with dark/light mode.** iOS does **not** support alternate app icons that automatically switch based on dark/light mode. However:

**Options:**

	â€¢	**Primary Icon**: Use a neutral design that works in both modes.
	â€¢	**Alternate Icons** (Optional):
	â€¢	You can provide alternate icons and let the user choose one manually via UIApplication.shared.setAlternateIconName(...)
	â€¢	Youâ€™ll need to declare them in the Info.plist.

ðŸ”” You canâ€™t dynamically switch icons based on system appearance without user interaction.

âœ…** 4. Checklist for App Icon Setup**

	1.	Export images from ChatGPT or design tool in **PNG** format.
	2.	Resize them to all required dimensions (or use tools like Xcode or appicon.co).
	3.	Open your Xcode project:
	â€¢	Go to Assets.xcassets.
	â€¢	Use or create AppIcon image set.
	â€¢	Drag images into the correct slots.
	4.	Ensure your appâ€™s Info.plist refers to the correct AppIcon set.
	5.	Clean & rebuild to test how icons show up.
