# SPARK notes

Good morning

I’m Kavi, 
here 
on behalf 
of our 
super talented 
Digital Experience team 

I’m happy to share 3 updates
we’ve been working on
To help customers save money 
And really feel those savings

The first update 
is about 

subscribe to save
So excited to launch this
In our app just last month 

And already off to a great start

Where customers can 
Subscribe to the consumable items 

they buy all the time

Which not only helps  
them save money 

But also time

we’ve projected this program 
to grow up to 
and beyond $30m

I love this feature! 
Definitely check it out 

if you haven’t already.

The second update is a 
small but mighty one

We’re always looking for ways

To HIGHLIGHT 

The amazing savings 

That our merchants 
And marketplace teams
Work so hard to get

And we want to make sure
Theses saving really pop online

So this one is about showing 

The exact DOLLARS customers will save

On each item 

While they’re searching and browsing

This tiny change 
will drive 
an incremental 
$9m this year 

Tiny changes can make a big difference 

And finally
Our category and 
cross category 
digital experiences teams 
have been working hard 
to find find different ways 
to tell savings stories 
to our customers 

To make 
shopping 
Our categories
Or our seasonal events
Easy and fun!

This is great work team, thank you,!

And now I’ll and it over to Mel

 Thanks everyone!
