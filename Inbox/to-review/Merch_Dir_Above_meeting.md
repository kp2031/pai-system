**# Merch Dir Above meeting**

Thank you for your time and attention - I hope at the end of these 6-7 slides that I’ll share, you’ll take-away something you may not have known about how our customers shop online - from how they get to our online store to the format they shop down to how they convert or buy. 

I’m always happy to answer questions now, or even 1-1 if you’d like to go deeper.

Title slide:

**Customer insights and online shopping behaviour **

Section title slide:
**CUSTOMER INSIGHTS ​Top traffic drivers and trends**

**How do our customers get to Walmart.ca?**

- There are so many paths customers take to get to Walmart.ca across the internet 

From paths that a few free for Walmart and others that we pay for.

- But it’s always good to know that there are ways we don’t need to pay for Optimizing our hierarchy, page titles and page descriptions for search engines like Google… called SEO - Search Engine Optimization and that’s something we work on, but don’t need to pay companies like Google for.

- Then there are tactics to get people to visit Walmart.ca that we have to pay for, via various partners like Google, Facebook and others
- An example of one of the bigger tactics is Search Engine Marketing or SEM

**What are our top traffic drivers?**

- Now here is the pie chart that shows the proportion of customers that come to our site via Unpaid - in blue - versus paid in orange
- Close to three quarters of our traffic comes from Unpaid 
- And roughly one quarter comes from Paid
- What is interesting here is that only one third of customers looking for something type in Walmart.ca directly vs. 60% go to Google and type in 4 burner grill
- So the SEO work the cross-functional teams work on together during Site Audits is super important and drives the most traffic

**Which devices are customers using when they’re ****_visiting our site_****? **

Two-thirds of visitors use mobile (app or web), with mobile visitors on the green site skewing towards the app

* We manage 3 experiences to serve the customer in whichever way they want to shop. 
* Device type = online store format! 
* The Mobile web and App experience grow year after year, and now account for most of the traffic. 

- On the far right you can see that 16% of customers are using our App, 
- 43% are using our mobile website
- 36% are using our desktop website
- When adding App and mobile web usage together you can see that over 60% of our customers access Walmart through their mobile device, 
- Which is why it’s so important that we always build our experiences mobile first. 

**Which devices are customers using when ****_making a purchase_**** online?**

- Now that we know how customers are visiting us, the next question is how do they convert or buy? 
- This bar graph shows the conversion rate of our blue site and green site as well as all the device splits. 
- The first thing to note is that blue site conversion is much lower than green site and that’s because there are two very different shopping journeys. 
- On blue site, customers are often researching or looking for inspiration on products, 
- Where as green site is more of a weekly shop where they buy their groceries and consumable items. 

Section break:

**PRODUCT FINDING METHODS​**
**What are our customers preferred product finding methods? **
**
**
**PRODUCT FINDING METHODS**
* There are on-site and off-site ​ways for customers to discover products on Walmart.ca 
* These are referred to as  product finding methods 

- Product finding methods are simply the different ways customers can get to product pages, or PIPs for short. There are on-site and off-site ways for customers to land on a PIP. 
- First, lets go over the three on-site product finding methods. 

**## Which ****_## PIP_****##  finding methods are our customers using on the ****_## blue site_****## ? **
- More than two-thirds of Product Info Page views on the blue site come through on-site methods
- Search being the most popular off-site and on-site product finding method

* Customers can browse the site by navigating the web hierarchy, which represents 23% of traffic. 
* They can search specific terms which represents 35% 
* They can be led to items via product recommendations, which represents 10%  
* Or they can land from an external source (paid or un-paid ) which represents 31% of the traffic 
* Site merchandisers factor in this split during audits to help optimize the areas of opportunity and drive the right level of focus where warranted.  

**## Which on-site ****_## add to cart_****##  methods are our customers using on the ****_## green site_****## ? **

Nearly three-quarters of items on the green site are added to our customers’ baskets ​ via search and recommendations (easy reorder, recommendation carousels, etc.)

The split we just talked about was for the _blue site_ which is more General Merchandise - it was about getting to the PIP
- On the green site it’s more about how customers “add to cart”

The same actions are reviewed for both the blue site and the green site as the customer tends to navigate the two very differently. 

In this example you will notice a heavier weighting on search and carousel use. 

This will prompt site merchandisers to change their approach on how to optimize green site pages vs. Blue site pages. 

**The conversion funnel**

**We all have a role to play in converting visits to orders!**
**
**
- The conversion funnel is a super simplified visualization to understand performance along the customer shopping experience.  
- Conversion is a KPI that is impacted by many different teams at Walmart and we all have a role to play in improving conversion. 
- At the top of the funnel we have Visits 
- Visits are impacted by our digital marketing team, Search Engine Optimization team and your category experience team.  The objective is to drive customers through unpaid and paid channels to Walmart.ca.  KPI’s that are used to measure visits is total visits as well as return on Ad spend. 
- Once a customer visits Walmart.ca  we want to convert them into product views by providing them an easy browse or search experience.  Your Category Experience team and site merchandisers are key in converting visits to product views.  A lot of what we talked about today to improve search and browse is focused on driving a higher product view/visit numbers.  Our KPI are browse and search click through, product recommendation %. 
- Once a customer has found and viewed a product we want them to add that awesome product to their cart.  This is where Merchants and marketplace partners have a huge impact on total conversion.  Great assortment, content, price and availability are key in converting product views to add to carts. 
- Finally we want those add to carts to convert to check outs and orders.  This is where our digital experience, product and tech teams impact conversion.  Ensuring we have a frictionless user experience before purchase help drives overall conversion. 

- I hope this visualization has illustrated how we all have a role to play in improving our total conversion on Walmart and helping our customers quickly and easily find the products they love.
