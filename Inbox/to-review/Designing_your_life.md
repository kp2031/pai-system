# Designing your life

Designing your life
By: Bill Burnett and Dave Evans

Five mindsets of a designer
1. Curiosity
2. Biased to action (try stuff)
3. Re-framing
4. Awareness
5. Radical collaboration

Breakdown of life into discrete areas:

- Health 
- Work 
- Play
- Love

If it’s not actionable it’s not a problem… It’s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life (gravity problem)
