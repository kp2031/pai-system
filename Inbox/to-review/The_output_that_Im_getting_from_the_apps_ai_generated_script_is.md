# The output that I’m getting from the app’s ai generated script is…

The output that I’m getting from the app’s ai generated script is very bad. I’d like to brainstorm ways that I can turn the bullet points that I’m requesting the user enter about roughly what they want to talk about for their speech. Taking those rough bullet points and turning them into a solid speech script is my current challenge. The current generation of a script is very bad. I would like to figure out how to proceed in a step-by-step way and it can be an iterative process where we give the app bullet points that we give it and then see what the output is and I can share with you what that output was. We can evaluate and try to hypothesis why the output was what it was and then we can come up with a plan on how to improve it and then do this over and over.

I’m very new to coding and building and developing at everything and so if you’re able to help me understand how the best practice developers think about this process that would be very helpful one of the YouTube channels that I really love watching that is helping me think about these things from a technical perspective is called AI engineer. I have a background in systems engineering, but that has been over 20 years ago and so I roughly understand how things work but if you can assume that I have grade 9 knowledge of programming that would be great.
