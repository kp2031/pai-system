Test - edits 

Hello everyone, hope everyone is doing well.

There are 3 topics I want to give an update on - 1. Annual planning timeline, 2. financial analysis and 3. white paper word documents. 

The first is timeline - so we need a first draft of the financial analysis at the beginning of August and then a second draft of the financial analysis mid August and then finally white papers drafted for the second last week of August and final drafts at the end of August. This gives me a week to draft the white papers at my level. 

For financial analysis, we need to make sure you all get all your projects to have a business value. Use AI for this if you need help bridging your operational or technical metric to a GMV equivalent - top line growth or bottom line improvement.  

Does anyone have any questions about what needs to be done and what when itâ€™s due?

Thanks team!
