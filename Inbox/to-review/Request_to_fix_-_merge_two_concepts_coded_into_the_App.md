# Request to fix / merge two concepts coded into the App

 There are two concepts "Speaking calendar" and "Library" that I feel we need to merge into one concept. We 
  have built these both up in parallel and I think it's time to merge these two concepts. I like the screen 
  titled Library and the list view of cards. And I really like event view e.g. "Team meeting" in the "Speaking
   calendar" tab. But we need to merge these two concepts in some kind of hierarchy. Maybe there are events 
  with dates, and then there are scripts and then you rehearse the scripts and then the rehearsals have their 
  own analytics and the analytics roll up into the event summary and analytics. What do you think? Think 
  harder about this.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to think about merging two concepts - "Speaking Calendar" and "Library". Let me 
  analyze what we have:

  1. Speaking Calendar: Shows upcoming events with dates, focuses on event management
  2. Library: Shows list of cards (likely speeches/scripts), focuses on content management

  The user likes:
  - The Library screen with its list view of cards
  - The event view (like "Team meeting") from Speaking Calendar

  They're suggesting a hierarchy:
  - Events (with dates)
    - Scripts (content for events)
        - Rehearsals (practice sessions)
            - Analytics (performance metrics)

  This makes a lot of sense. Currently we have two separate flows that overlap:
  - Events can have scripts and rehearsals
  - Library likely has standalone speeches/scripts that can also be rehearsed

  The conceptual merge would create a unified flow where:
  1. Everything starts with content (scripts/speeches)
  2. Scripts can be associated with events (optional)
  3. Scripts can be rehearsed multiple times
  4. Each rehearsal generates analytics
  5. Analytics roll up to show overall progress

  Let me think about this hierarchy more deeply...

  Current state:
  - Speaking Calendar: Event-focused (events → scripts → rehearsals)
  - Library: Content-focused (speeches → rehearsals)

  Proposed unified model:
  - Primary entity: Content (Scripts/Speeches)
  - Secondary entity: Events (optional container for scripts with dates/venues)
  - Tertiary entity: Rehearsals (practice sessions for scripts)
  - Quaternary entity: Analytics (performance data for each rehearsal)

  This would mean:
  1. Library becomes the main tab showing all scripts/speeches
  2. Scripts can be standalone OR associated with events
  3. Event information (date, venue) is metadata on scripts when applicable
  4. Speaking Calendar could become a filtered view of Library showing only scripts with upcoming events

  Benefits:
  - Single source of truth for content
  - Flexibility to rehearse with or without events
  - Clear hierarchy: Content → Event (optional) → Rehearsals → Analytics

  I can leverage a single script across multiple contexts, creating maximum flexibility for content reuse and 
  adaptation.

⏺ You're absolutely right - we need to think about this more holistically. Let me analyze the current state
  and propose a unified conceptual model.
