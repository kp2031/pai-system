# Performance Reviews

Over the past year, I’ve focused on advancing our strategic initiatives - Dx initiatives, WCP prep, analytics and testing. This was all brought to life by empowering our teams, and enhancing the experience for our customers. Below are only a few summary highlights and achievements.

1. Empowering Ted’s Team
* 		Enhancing Customer Insights: Utilized tools like Quantum Metric and Qualtrics to delve into customer feedback, identifying and addressing key user experience issues.
* 		Developing Accessible Dashboards: Led the migration to Looker, creating intuitive dashboards that improved data accessibility and informed decision-making across teams.
* 		Improving Stakeholder Engagement: Built strong relationships through open communication, contributing to a higher stakeholder engagement score.

2. Collaborating with DX Analytics

3. Prioritizing Tests Using Historical Data

* 		Empowering Team Members: Provided access to historical and international test results through a self-serve portal, enabling data-driven decisions - and testing / feedback from the team.
* 		Enhancing Global Collaboration: Partnered with international teams to share test results, helping us avoid redundant efforts and leverage broader insights.

4. Streamlining Digital Enhancements with Eli’s Team

* 		Maintaining Reporting Integrity: Ensured critical data points remained available for stakeholders throughout the transition.
* 		Monitoring Performance: Developed reports to track the new platform’s performance, aiding informed decision-making.

7. Fostering a High-Performance Team Culture
	•	Developing Talent: Collaborated on Individual Development Plans and held regular one-on-one meetings to support team growth.
	•	Enhancing Team Engagement: Shared engagement survey results and worked together on action plans to improve our team environment.

8. Enhancing the Customer Shopping Experience
* 		Focusing on Customer Needs: Aimed to make us the preferred digital shopping destination, especially in power categories.
* 		Implementing Improvements: Made enhancements to the website and app, like personalized recommendations and better navigation, to boost customer satisfaction.

I’m really proud of the progress we’ve made in advancing our Dx initiatives driving close to $90m year to date with one quarter left in the year by really improving key customer experiences in shopping, search and recommendations. This is also on top of building a strong analytics and testing function for the Dx org. And all of this was all driven by building strong relationships across many stakeholders and maintaining a high bar throughout.

I’m grateful for the support and opportunities this year and look forward to what we can achieve together moving forward.
