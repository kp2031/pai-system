# PowerPoint agent swarm

What is the best way to build a team of ai agents / ai agent stack that can work on my PowerPoint slides? I want them to improve the titles and turn them into McKinsey style action titles, I want a separate agent to write great bullet points, I want a separate agent to build McKinsey style graphs, I want an agent to do deep data analysis and data gathering from public sources, and then another agent to build visual slide elements like arrows and text boxes and then another agent to make sure all the visual elements have a good balance, well aligned with each other and have a sense of harmony, an agent to ensure the colour coding of the slide matches the corporate colour scheme and then finally an agent to write tiny source lines at the bottom.
