Digits disruption + Retail disruption + Marketing disruption = chaos

Prime time used to be Saturday evening 

Google is Prime time

It’s not time anymore 

Shifting from heart to science 

MadMen to MathMen

Funnel is dead

It’s not about building 

Flyer
- Great prices, mass appeal, drive traffic and sales

Don’t try to be who you’re not
- what’s the point of driving online sales 
- Margins are lower
- If you’re not serving your stores
- What’s the point 

Don’t measure ROAS
- focus on offline conversion 

Who you are (store retailer) - not who you’re not (online pure play)

Physical stores - traffic 

Do all proofs on Mobile
Product listing Ads - visual search = mobile

Mobile is local, local drives store 

Online drives store 

Smart shopping is perfect for in-house marketing
