Ted - how much GMV is equivalent to 1bps improvement in conversion rate?

Ken - how many categories did we setup in RR for PAC page? And are they all a variation of bought also bought? do we have any adobe metrics since we launched it / post AB test?

On partial check out - how many people check out only one? What’s the percentage that check out their groceries and leave the unscheduled item vs leaving scheduled?

What time do orders cut off / end amends - is it midnight?

How can we convert the increase in customers using amends to GMV
- 14% of scheduled orders are amended
- Average amended amount is $22

- US saw amend increase 2%
- 7.7m orders / year
- 2m orders to go

- 2% more to be amended
- $800k GMV

And how much GMV does $10m contribute to going from 25% comp to a 30% comp?

Watch Andrew’s video - Does the amends flow show the hours and min left to amend your order?

Cart is where you play and check out is where you pay

Ken \ Rebecca - when are we launching post at the cart page in app?

Ken/Rebecca - What percentage of our schedule orders get amended?
