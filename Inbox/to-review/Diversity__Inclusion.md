# Diversity & Inclusion

Diversity & Inclusion

1. Managing s diverse workforce is not easy 

How you want change to happen?

Political example 

All colonies of the British - When and how did the change happen?

USA - Independence - July 4, 1776

India - Aug 15, 1947

Nigeria - Oct 1, 1960

Jamaica - Aug 6, 1962

Hong Kong - July 1, 1997

Canada - July 1 - 1867, 1871 one currency, 1915 own military, 1947 first Canadian Passport, 1949 own Supreme Court, 1965 own flag

Different thoughts about what a good job

Sliced bread approach

Culture is the way we do things when nobody tells us what to do 

Canadians are trained:
Waiting in line - assumption - when I get to the front of the line, what I want will still be available 

Personality driven behavior vs Group (Culture) driven behavior 
In group and out of group 

Humanity or individual behavior - generational 

Everyone I know eats dinner at different times 
France 8pm
Germans earlier 6pm
Spain 10pm
On a reserve (aboriginal) always food in the kitchen and you eat when you’re hungry

Even the concept of dinner time is cultural

Canadians - if you’re 5 min late
Up to 10:10 you’re 

Germany 9:57 to start at 10

Mexico - north 30min late is ok, south 45min is ok

When there’s an issue - tension - shift change 

Generalizations (positive) vs Stereotype (negative)
- stereotype... all... always... judgmental 
- Changing behavior preemptively 
- Generalizations - guidelines, variation, words neutral (on average Mexicans have a more flexible sense of time)

Does that mean they can have what you consider bad behavior?

Short term - diversity is a pain, but long term there’s benefits 

Creativity and innovation - reduces blind-spots

1. Communicating more effectively

Context - where are we meeting, what’s going on around 

Germans - right to the point 

Canadians - straight forward but less on the nose

Asian countries - Anything but the real point of the conversation 

See if you’re having the impact you’re trying to have?

Pay close attention to what the reactions
If not, stop and discuss.

Misunderstandings can lead to mistrust.

Golden rule needs to be replaced by the:
**Platinum rule**, do unto others as they want done unto them

Movie - Outsourced - watch it - end of the movie - airport scene
