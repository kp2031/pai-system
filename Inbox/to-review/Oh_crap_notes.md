# Oh crap notes

|  Theme<br/> | Sub-Theme<br/> | Key Points<br/> | Quotes/Suggestions<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|  Preparation<br/> | Awareness<br/> | - Identify signs of readiness in your child, such as interest in the bathroom, staying dry for longer periods, and communicating bathroom needs.<br/> | "I've noticed you seem interested in the toilet. That's awesome!"<br/> |
|   | Environment Setup<br/> | - Create a supportive environment with easy access to a potty. Consider having multiple potties within reach throughout the house.<br/> | "Here's a special potty just for you. You can use it anytime you need."<br/> |
|  Implementation<br/> | Phase 1: Naked Time<br/> | - Begin with a block of time where your child is naked from the waist down, to help them recognize the sensation of needing to go.<br/> | "Let's play a game where you try to put pee in the potty. It's okay if we miss sometimes!"<br/> |
|   | Phase 2: Commando<br/> | - Transition to loose-fitting pants without underwear, helping your child practice pulling pants down and up for potty use.<br/> | "Can you show me how fast you can pull down your pants and use the potty?"<br/> |
|   | Phase 3: Leaving Home<br/> | - Start short outings to teach your child to use public restrooms, gradually increasing outing duration.<br/> | "Let's see if we can find the potty together at the store. It's like a treasure hunt!"<br/> |
|  Troubleshooting<br/> | Accidents<br/> | - Treat accidents as learning opportunities rather than failures. Stay calm and reassure your child.<br/> | "Oops! Accidents happen. Next time, we'll try to get to the potty faster."<br/> |
|   | Resistance<br/> | - Address resistance with patience, understanding, and consistency. Avoid power struggles.<br/> | "It's okay if you're not ready to go right now. We can try again later."<br/> |
|  Parental Mindset<br/> | Patience and Support<br/> | - Be patient and supportive. Understand that setbacks are part of the process.<br/> | "I'm so proud of you for trying. We'll keep practicing together."<br/> |
|   | Consistency<br/> | - Maintain consistency in approach, routines, and responses to successes and accidents.<br/> | "Every day we'll have time to practice using the potty. It's part of our routine."<br/> |
|  Advanced Topics<br/> | Night Training<br/> | - Tackle night training after day success. Limit liquids before bedtime and ensure a potty is accessible at night.<br/> | "Let's use the potty one more time before bed to keep your bed dry tonight."<br/> |
|   | Public Outings<br/> | - Prepare for outings with a portable potty or familiarize with public restrooms. Encourage bathroom visits before leaving home.<br/> | "Before we go on our adventure, let's try to use the potty. It might help us stay dry while we're out."<br/> |

Remember, the tone of voice, positivity, and reassurance are as important as the words themselves. Tailor these suggestions to your child's unique personality and your family's approach to communication for the best results.

The "Oh Crap! Potty Training" method by Jamie Glowacki is structured around progressive blocks that guide children from recognizing the need to go to the bathroom to being able to use the potty independently. Here's a breakdown of these blocks and some suggested quotes or phrases for each to support and encourage your child through the process.
|  Block<br/> | Description<br/> | Quotes/Suggestions<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  Block 1<br/> | Focus on the child being naked and learning to recognize the sensation of needing to pee or poop, then getting to the potty in time.<br/> | "Your body is telling you it's time to pee. Let's try to get it in the potty next time."<br/> |
|  Block 2<br/> | Introduction of clothing without underwear. The child practices pulling down their pants and using the potty. There should be an increased awareness of the need to go.<br/> | "Can you feel if it's time to go pee? Remember, no undies means it's easier to use the potty!"<br/> |
|  Block 3<br/> | Incorporate leaving the house with short trips. This block teaches the child to hold it longer and use different potties.<br/> | "Let's go on a potty adventure! We can see how other potties look and use them if we need."<br/> |
|  Block 4<br/> | Addressing any remaining resistance or issues, like night training or poop anxiety. The child should be fairly independent but might need help with wiping or managing clothing.<br/> | "You're doing so great using the potty! If you need help, I'm here, especially if it's a poop."<br/> |
|  Block 5<br/> | The child is fully trained for daytime and possibly nighttime. They should be initiating going to the potty themselves and managing most of the process independently.<br/> | "You're a potty pro now! Remember, it's okay to ask for help if you're having a tough time or can't reach something."<br/> |
|  Block 6 (if applicable)<br/> | Fine-tuning and mastering any challenging scenarios, like public restrooms, long car rides, or overnight stays away from home.<br/> | "Every potty is a bit different, but you know what to do. Let's make a plan for our trip so we're ready for potty breaks."<br/> |

For each block, it's important to communicate with patience, positivity, and encouragement. Tailoring your approach and language based on your child's reactions and preferences is key. Celebrate successes, however small, and treat any accidents or setbacks as learning opportunities without punishment or negative reactions.
