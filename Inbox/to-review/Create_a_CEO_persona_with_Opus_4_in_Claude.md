# Create a CEO persona with Opus 4 in Claude

Hi, I'm building out an iOS + watchOS app in Claude code right now. 

It’s an iOS + watchOS app that helps users rehearse and deliver public speeches by monitoring heart rate in real time and providing haptic feedback to slow down or take a breath, while leveraging the iPhone camera for video‑based practice sessions. It specifies frameworks (HealthKit, WatchKit, WatchConnectivity, AVFoundation, Core ML), key interactions (haptics, complications, live metrics), and data sync between devices, ensuring both on‑wrist coaching and on‑phone analysis.

I want you to be the CEO of this company. 

Whenever the Al is building, I'm going to come and chat with you and get your advice and guidance. 

How does that sound?
