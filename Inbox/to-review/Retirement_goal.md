# Retirement goal

Let’s determine the minimum amount you need to contribute to your **RRSP** annually in order to hit your target of **$2.92 million** by age 55, while maintaining the TFSA contribution schedule we've already set.
**## 1. RRSP Target and Current Balance**
Your RRSP target is **$2.92 million** by age 55, and you already have **$200,000** in the account. The assumed annual growth rate is 20%, and you have 12 years to reach the goal.
**## 2. RRSP Growth Without Contributions**
First, let’s calculate how much your current **$200,000** will grow by itself, without additional contributions, at 20% over the next 12 years:
F
V
=
200
,
000
×
(

+
0.20
)
12
=
200
,

8.9161

,
783
,
222
FV=200,000×(1+0.20)12=200,000×8.9161=1,783,222

Your current $200,000 will grow to **$1.78 million** without any contributions.
**## 3. Remaining Amount to Reach RRSP Target**
Now, calculate the gap you need to fill with additional contributions:

2,920,000−1,783,222=1,136,778
You need to accumulate **$1,136,778** over the next 12 years through annual RRSP contributions.
**## 4. Minimum Annual RRSP Contribution Required**
We’ll now calculate the minimum annual contribution required to close this gap, using the future value of a series formula, assuming 20% growth:
F
V
=
P

(

r
FV=P×r(1+r)12−1
Where:
* F V = 1 , 136 , 778   FV=1,136,778 (the gap you need to fill)
* r = 0.20   r=0.20 (20% growth rate)
* t = 12   t=12 (number of years)

Plugging in the numbers:

P=37.2751,136,778 =30,489**

**5. Minimum Annual RRSP Contribution**
To hit your target of **$2.92 million** in the RRSP by age 55, you need to contribute approximately **$30,489 per year** for the next 12 years.
**## 6. Summary of Contributions**
|  **Account Type**<br/> | **Current Balance**<br/> | **Annual Contribution**<br/> | **Projected Value at Retirement**<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|  **RRSP**<br/> | $200,000<br/> | $30,489<br/> | $2.92 million<br/> |
|  **TFSA**<br/> | $0<br/> | $16,500 (over 10 years)<br/> | $1.02 million<br/> |
|  **Total**<br/> |  |  | **$3.94 million**<br/> |

**7. Analysis**
With the **minimum annual RRSP contribution of $30,489** and your planned TFSA contributions, you will meet your RRSP target of $2.92 million and accumulate a total of **$3.94 million** across both accounts by age 55.
Since this still leaves you a bit short of the total retirement target of **$4.86 million**, consider:
* **Taxable Investments**: If possible, invest any additional savings in a taxable account to further grow your retirement portfolio.
* **CPP and Social Security**: Remember, starting CPP and potentially U.S. Social Security at age 70 will further reduce the amount you need from your investment accounts during retirement.

This strategy gives you a clear path to achieving your retirement goals while minimizing the annual RRSP contribution.
