# Explaining the values behind "being woke" to a social conservative…

Explaining the values behind "being woke" to a social conservative can be more challenging, as they may hold traditional views that conflict with some aspects of being woke. However, it's essential to find common ground and use language that resonates with their values. Here's a breakdown of the main values associated with being woke that you can use as a starting point when speaking to a social conservative:
1. Emphasize common values: Many social conservatives believe in the importance of strong communities and fairness. Emphasize that the values of being woke, such as equality and inclusivity, can contribute to building a stronger and more cohesive society that benefits everyone.
2. Focus on human dignity and respect: Social conservatives often place high importance on moral values. Frame being woke as a way to respect the dignity and worth of every individual, regardless of their background. This approach can help create a bridge between the two ideologies.
3. Highlight the importance of empathy: Being woke involves understanding and empathizing with the struggles and experiences of marginalized groups. Encourage the social conservative to consider how empathy can lead to stronger relationships and communities.
4. Address misconceptions: Social conservatives may have preconceived notions about what being woke entails. Clarify that being woke doesn't necessarily mean abandoning traditional values or promoting divisiveness, but rather it's about understanding the complex social issues that impact various groups of people.
5. Encourage open dialogue: Stress the importance of open and respectful dialogue to learn from one another and build bridges between different perspectives. Emphasize that being woke is not about shutting down conversations but fostering understanding and growth through listening and engaging with diverse viewpoints.
6. Share relatable examples: Use real-life examples that illustrate the positive impact of being woke. Share stories of people from different backgrounds coming together to create positive change or communities that have benefited from inclusive policies and practices.
7. Appeal to religious values: If the social conservative is religious, consider using religious teachings about compassion, justice, and love for one's neighbor as a basis for discussing the values behind being woke. Many religious principles align with the core values of empathy, understanding, and working towards a more inclusive society.

By focusing on these points, you can create a more relatable and accessible understanding of the values behind being woke for a social conservative. Remember to be patient, respectful, and open to their perspective as well, as this will encourage a more productive and meaningful dialogue.

Prompt: Steelman what being woke is

———

A steelman argument is a representation of an opposing viewpoint in its strongest, most persuasive form. In the case of being woke, it can be described as follows:
Being woke is a conscious effort to recognize, understand, and challenge systemic inequalities and societal issues that affect marginalized groups. It is a call for empathy, open-mindedness, and solidarity, urging individuals to be aware of the complex social dynamics that shape our world. At its core, being woke is not about promoting division or disregarding traditional values but rather about fostering inclusivity and advocating for a more equitable society.
1. Social awareness: Being woke requires individuals to be informed about historical and ongoing injustices that impact various groups of people. This awareness is necessary to address and remedy these issues.
2. Intersectionality: Being woke acknowledges that social issues are interconnected and that different forms of discrimination and privilege intersect. This holistic approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of societal problems.
3. Allyship: As part of being woke, individuals are encouraged to actively support marginalized communities, speaking out against injustices and promoting initiatives that work towards equality.
4. Active listening and learning: Being woke involves being open to learning from others, particularly those directly affected by social issues. This value emphasizes the importance of listening to diverse perspectives and being willing to change one's own views based on new information.
5. Equality and inclusivity: At the heart of being woke is the belief in equal opportunities and inclusivity for all, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or other factors. This commitment to inclusivity leads to stronger communities and more cohesive societies.

By presenting being woke as a movement that seeks to address systemic inequalities and promote empathy, understanding, and inclusivity, we can emphasize its positive intentions and constructive impact. This steelman argument portrays being woke as a call for social awareness and active engagement in fostering a more equitable and just society for everyone, regardless of their background.
