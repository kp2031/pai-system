  "language_tone": [
    "Use short, direct sentences — plain English over jargon.",

    "Ensure all titles and text pass the ‘so what?’ test for relevance."
  ]
  "data_driven_storytelling": [
    "Quantify all claims where possible — use numbers to anchor insights.",
    "Use deltas and changes, not just absolutes — 'sales rose 8%' not 'sales were $1.2M'.",
