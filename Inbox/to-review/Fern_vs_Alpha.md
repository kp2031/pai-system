**## Additional Notes**
1. **Alpha Alternative School** is known for its democratic governance model—students, teachers, and parents often work collaboratively to shape the learning experience. Children who enjoy hands-on, project-based activities and who flourish in environments where they have a say in their learning often do well in this setting.
2. **Fern Avenue Public School**, like most traditional public schools, adheres to a more standardized curriculum but still offers diverse programs and extracurricular activities. Many children succeed in structured settings where learning outcomes are clearly outlined and assessed.
3. While both schools come under the Toronto District School Board (TDSB), their philosophies and day-to-day practices can differ considerably. The choice ultimately depends on the child’s learning style, family preferences, and the desired level of involvement in school governance.
