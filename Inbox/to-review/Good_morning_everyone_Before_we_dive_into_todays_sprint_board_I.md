# Good morning, everyone! Before we dive into today’s sprint board, I…

Good morning, everyone! Before we dive into today’s sprint board, I want to talk about *dog-fooding*—the simple idea of using what we build, every day, just like our customers will.

Why does it matter? First, it shortens the feedback loop to almost zero. When *we* rely on our product, we feel every rough edge, celebrate every delight, and spot every blocker long before a support ticket appears. That’s the fastest possible QA cycle—no extra meetings required.

Second, it sharpens our empathy. Numbers in a dashboard are useful, but nothing beats the gut check of personally saying, “This bug ruined my morning.” Empathy like that drives better decisions than any metric ever will.

Third, it unites us. We’re a 12-person crew, which means each of us can own a slice of the experience end-to-end. When marketing, design, and engineering all share the same frustrations—and the same “aha” moments—we stop being functions and start being a single user-obsessed team.

So here’s the challenge for the next two weeks:
	1.	**Adopt**: Make our product the default for the task it solves. Remove the alternative from your workflow.
	2.	**Journal**: Jot down one friction point and one delight every day. Tiny notes—nothing fancy.
	3.	**Share**: In our daily stand-up, each person brings one observation. No blame, no defensiveness—just curiosity and fixes.

At the end of the fortnight we’ll review the patterns, ship the quick wins, and size up the bigger ones for the roadmap.

Dog-fooding isn’t extra work; it *is* the work. Let’s lead by example and make our product something we’re proud—and excited—to use every single day. Thanks, and let’s get to it!
