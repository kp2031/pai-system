# Financial planning notes, 2025

We'll consider the maximum contribution limits for each account type and include a taxable investment account to cover any remaining gap. We'll also maintain the **7-year** timeframe and a **20% annual growth rate** for your investments.

**1. Updated Contribution Limits and Current Balances****
**
**RRSP:**

* **Current Balance:** $200,000
* **Unused Contribution Room:** $195,158
* **Annual Contribution Limit (2024):** $31,560 (assuming you have sufficient income to contribute the maximum)
* **Total New RRSP Room over 7 Years:** $31,560 * 7 = $220,920
* **Total RRSP Contribution Room over 7 Years:** $195,158 (unused) + $220,920 (new) = **$416,078**

**TFSA:**

* **Current Balance:** $0
* **Unused Contribution Room:** $110,224
* **Annual Contribution Limit (2024):** $6,500 (this may increase slightly due to inflation adjustments)
* **Total New TFSA Room over 7 Years:** $6,500 * 7 = $45,500
* **Total TFSA Contribution Room over 7 Years:** $110,224 (unused) + $45,500 (new) = **$155,724**

**2. RRSP Contribution and Growth Calculation****
**
**a. Annual RRSP Contributions****
**
To utilize your total RRSP contribution room over 7 years:
* **Annual RRSP Contribution:** $416,078 / 7 ≈ **$59,440**

**b. Growth of Current RRSP Balance**
Calculating the future value (FV) of your existing $200,000 at 20% annual growth over 7 years:
FV_{\text{existing}} = 200,000 \times (1 + 0.20)^7 = 200,000 \times 3.5832 = **$716,640****
**
**c. Future Value of RRSP Contributions****
**
Calculating the FV of your annual contributions:
FV_{\text{contributions}} = 59,440 \times \left( \frac{(1 + 0.20)^7 - 1}{0.20} \right) = 59,440 \times 12.9159 = **$767,820****
**
**d. Total RRSP Balance at Retirement****
**
FV_{\text{RRSP total}} = FV_{\text{existing}} + FV_{\text{contributions}} = 716,640 + 767,820 = **$1,484,460**

**3. TFSA Contribution and Growth Calculation****
**
**a. Annual TFSA Contributions****
**
To utilize your total TFSA contribution room over 7 years:
* **Annual TFSA Contribution:** $155,724 / 7 ≈ **$22,246**

**b. Future Value of TFSA Contributions**
Calculating the FV of your TFSA contributions:
FV_{\text{TFSA}} = 22,246 \times \left( \frac{(1 + 0.20)^7 - 1}{0.20} \right) = 22,246 \times 12.9159 = **$287,225**

**4. Total Projected Retirement Savings from RRSP and TFSA****
**
\text{Total Savings} = FV_{\text{RRSP total}} + FV_{\text{TFSA}} = 1,484,460 + 287,225 = **$1,771,685**

**5. Remaining Gap to Retirement Target****
**
Your retirement target is **$4,860,000**. Subtracting your projected RRSP and TFSA savings:
\text{Remaining Gap} = 4,860,000 - 1,771,685 = **$3,088,315**

**6. Taxable Investment Account Contributions**
To cover the remaining gap of **$3,088,315** over 7 years at a 20% annual growth rate:
**a. Calculate Required Annual Contribution****
**
Using the future value of a series formula:
F
V
=
P
×
(
(
1
+
r
)
n
−
1
r
)
FV=P×(r(1+r)n−1 )

Where:
* F V = 3 , 088 , 315   FV=3,088,315
* r = 0.20   r=0.20
* n = 7   n=7

Solving for 
P
P:
P = \frac{FV}{\left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right)} = \frac{3,088,315}{12.9159} = **$239,154** per year

**7. Summary of Annual Contributions****
**
|  **Account Type**<br/> | **Annual Contribution**<br/> | **Projected Value at Retirement**<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  **RRSP**<br/> | $59,440<br/> | $1,484,460<br/> |
|  **TFSA**<br/> | $22,246<br/> | $287,225<br/> |
|  **Taxable Investments**<br/> | $239,154<br/> | $3,088,315<br/> |
|  **Total**<br/> | **$320,840**<br/> | **$4,860,000**<br/> |

**8. Feasibility and Recommendations**
* **Total Annual Savings Required:** **$320,840**This amount may exceed practical limits based on your income and expenses.
* **Considerations:**

	* **Adjust the Timeframe:** Extending your investment horizon beyond 7 years can significantly reduce the annual savings required.
	* **Reevaluate Growth Rates:** A consistent 20% annual return is optimistic. More conservative growth rates (e.g., 6-8%) may provide a more realistic plan.
	* **Reduce Retirement Spending:** Assess if the annual retirement income need of $180,000 can be adjusted.
	* **Maximize Contributions:** Continue maximizing RRSP and TFSA contributions to benefit from tax advantages.
	* **Professional Advice:** Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies, especially considering cross-border tax implications due to your wife's U.S. citizenship.

**9. Alternative Scenario: Extending the Timeframe to 12 Years**
If achieving your retirement goal in 7 years is challenging, extending the timeframe to **12 years** can reduce the required annual contributions.
**Revised Annual Contributions Over 12 Years****
**
* **RRSP Annual Contribution:** $59,440 (same as before)
* **TFSA Annual Contribution:** $12,977 (total TFSA room $155,724 / 12)
* **Taxable Investment Annual Contribution:** Adjusted to meet the target over 12 years.

Calculations would show significantly lower annual contributions needed for the taxable investment account.

**10. Conclusion****
**
Based on your precise RRSP and TFSA contribution rooms:
* **Maximize your RRSP and TFSA contributions** to take full advantage of tax benefits.
* **Assess the feasibility** of contributing approximately **$239,154 annually** to a taxable investment account.
* **Consider adjusting your retirement plan** by extending the timeframe, adjusting expected returns, or modifying your retirement income needs.

ChatGPT
Thought for 12 seconds

**Mapping out monthly contributions**

I recalculated for 12 years, found the annual contributions, and now need to break these down into monthly RRSP, TFSA, and taxable account deposits for automation.
**Breaking down contributions**

I’m translating yearly contributions into monthly payments, making setups for RRSP, TFSA, and taxable investments, while keeping an eye on accurate calculations and contribution limits.
**Tracking progress**

OK, let me see. I’m thinking about TFSA contributions, which depend on the annual limit and unused room. Monthly contributions work, and setting up automatic payments ensures smooth progress.
**Reorganizing my approach**

OK, let me see. I’m breaking down my annual contributions into monthly amounts to streamline automated deposits. This method allows for consistent progress towards my retirement goals, ensuring I stay on track efficiently.
**Setting up contributions**

I’m thinking about dividing RRSP, TFSA, and taxable account contributions into equal monthly amounts, automating transfers to simplify management, and ensuring they align with annual limits.
**Adjusting contribution dynamics**

I’m thinking about updating retirement contributions by checking annual limits and recalculating monthly amounts to keep plans on track.
Certainly! Breaking down your annual contributions into monthly amounts will help you set up automated deposits and stay on track with your retirement savings plan. Here's how you can allocate your monthly contributions based on the 12-year plan with a 20% annual growth rate:

**1. Monthly Contribution Amounts****
**
**a. RRSP Contributions****
**
* **Annual Contribution:** $47,823
* **Monthly Contribution:**$ 47 , 823 ÷ 12 ≈ ∗ ∗ $ 3 , 985.25 ∗ ∗  per month    $47,823÷12≈∗∗$3,985.25∗∗ per month

**2. Setting Up Automated Deposits****
**
To ensure consistent saving, you can set up automatic monthly transfers for each account:
* **RRSP Automatic Deposit:** Set up a monthly transfer of **$3,985.25** to your RRSP account.
* **TFSA Automatic Deposit:** Set up a monthly transfer of **$1,307.08** to your TFSA account.
* **Taxable Investment Automatic Deposit:** Set up a monthly transfer of **$1,585.50** to your taxable investment account.

**3. Considerations for Automated Contributions****
**
**a. Adjusting for Contribution Limits****
**
* **RRSP Contribution Limits:**

	* Ensure your total annual RRSP contributions (including any employer contributions) do not exceed your **maximum allowable RRSP contribution room** for each year.
	* The annual limit may increase over time due to inflation adjustments. Keep an eye on the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) announcements each year.
* **TFSA Contribution Limits:**

	* Similarly, make sure your TFSA contributions do not exceed your **available TFSA contribution room**, which includes unused room from previous years plus the new annual limit.
	* The TFSA annual limit may also change, so adjust your contributions accordingly.

**b. Monitoring and Adjustments**
* **Annual Review:**

	* At the beginning of each year, review your contribution limits and adjust your monthly contributions if necessary.
	* Factor in any changes in income that may affect your RRSP contribution room.
* **Avoiding Over-Contribution:**

	* Over-contributing to RRSPs or TFSAs can result in penalties. Keep track of your contributions and available room.
	* Consider consulting with a financial advisor or using CRA's My Account service to monitor your contribution room.

**c. Investment Growth Rates**
* **Reinvestment of Returns:**

	* Ensure that the returns generated within each account are reinvested to capitalize on compound growth.
* **Portfolio Allocation:**

	* Work with a financial advisor to determine the appropriate investment mix to achieve the assumed 20% growth rate, keeping in mind that higher returns often come with higher risks.

**4. Additional Tips for Success****
**
**a. Dollar-Cost Averaging****
**
* By contributing monthly, you're practicing dollar-cost averaging, which can reduce the impact of market volatility on your investments over time.

**b. Tax Efficiency**
* **RRSP Contributions:**

	* Contributions to your RRSP are tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income. You might receive a tax refund, which you could reinvest.
* **Taxable Investments:**

	* Be mindful of taxes on investment income in your taxable account. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that generate lower taxable distributions.

**c. Cross-Border Tax Considerations**
* Given your wife's U.S. citizenship, there may be cross-border tax implications, especially with the TFSA (which the IRS does not recognize as tax-exempt).
* Consult a cross-border tax specialist to ensure compliance and optimize your family's tax situation.

**5. Summary Table****
**
|  **Account Type**<br/> | **Annual Contribution**<br/> | **Monthly Contribution**<br/> | **Projected Value at Retirement**<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|  **RRSP**<br/> | $47,823<br/> | $3,985.25<br/> | $3,565,948<br/> |
|  **TFSA**<br/> | $15,685<br/> | $1,307.08<br/> | $584,813<br/> |

|  **Total**<br/> | **$82,534**<br/> | **$6,877.83**<br/> | **$4,860,000**<br/> |

**6. Next Steps**
1. **Set Up Automatic Transfers:**

	* Contact your bank or use online banking to set up automatic monthly transfers to each investment account on a date that aligns with your cash flow (e.g., shortly after your salary is deposited).
2. **Coordinate with Payroll (For RRSP):**

	* If possible, arrange for RRSP contributions to be deducted directly from your paycheck. This can provide immediate tax relief and simplify the contribution process.
3. **Regularly Review Your Plan:**

	* Schedule annual reviews of your investment performance and financial plan.
	* Adjust your contributions if there are changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
4. **Stay Informed:**

	* Keep up-to-date with changes in tax laws and contribution limits for RRSPs and TFSAs.
	* Monitor your investment accounts to ensure they are performing as expected.
5. **Consult Professionals:**
