Market size and opportunity 

However, to understand Amazon's advertising market size and its share within the advertising categories it competes in the United States, the following sources are generally recommended:

4. **Insider Intelligence**: Provides in-depth analyses and data on digital advertising, including Amazon's positioning and strategies.
5. **Advertising Amazon's Official Reports**: Amazon’s quarterly and annual reports to shareholders often include insights into the advertising business's growth and strategic direction.

However, for detailed insights into Amazon's advertising market in Canada, including its size and share within the advertising categories it competes in, the following sources would typically be recommended:

1. **Statista**: Known for its vast collection of statistics, Statista likely offers targeted data on digital advertising in Canada, including insights into Amazon's performance.
2. **eMarketer** or **Insider Intelligence**: These sources provide analyses and reports on digital marketing trends, including detailed breakdowns by country and platform.
3. **IAB Canada**: The Interactive Advertising Bureau of Canada publishes reports and insights on digital advertising trends in the Canadian market, which may include data relevant to Amazon.
4. **Canadian Marketing Association (CMA)**: Provides insights, research, and data on the Canadian marketing landscape, potentially covering Amazon's advertising impact.

As of my last update in April 2023, Amazon's advertising business in the United States is a significant player in the digital advertising space. It's challenging to pinpoint an exact market share without the latest data, but reports from eMarketer and similar research firms have suggested that Amazon commands a substantial portion of the US digital advertising market, often cited as the third-largest digital advertising platform after Google and Facebook.

### Categories to Include:
1. **E-commerce Advertising**: Amazon's platform-specific ads, like Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, and Sponsored Display ads, are key components of its advertising revenue.
2. **Display and Video Ads**: Ads that appear on Amazon-owned properties and across the web through Amazon DSP.
3. **Audio Ads**: Advertising on Amazon Music and potentially other Amazon-owned audio platforms.

### Categories to Exclude:
1. **Search Engine Marketing (SEM)** outside Amazon: Google's AdWords and similar platforms are a separate category, even though Amazon competes indirectly by being a product search platform.
2. **Social Media Advertising**: Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter advertising are distinct categories, though Amazon's advertising can overlap in terms of target demographics.
3. **Traditional Advertising**: TV, radio, print, and outdoor advertising aren't direct components of Amazon's advertising business, focusing instead on digital channels.

It's important to note that Amazon's advertising business significantly intersects with its e-commerce platform, making it unique compared to more traditional digital advertising platforms. Amazon leverages its vast amounts of shopping and purchase behavior data to offer highly targeted advertising solutions, a significant competitive advantage that might not directly compare with other digital advertising categories focused more on content consumption behaviors.
