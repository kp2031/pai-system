# Startup playbook

Startup playbook

	1.	Go heads down
	2.	Find an underserved niche + trend backed by data (start small)
	3.	Learn their pain points/what content drives them
	4.	Come up with an idea (or steal one from Ideabrowser.com)
	5.	Build an audience/community (pick 1 platform)
	6.	Use Manus/v0/Bolt/Lovable/Cursor to build v1
	7.	DM your audience, offer a discounted version
	8.	Reinvest that cash to fund product/content flywheel
	9.	Keep team small (AI is your co-founder)
	10.	Automate ~90% + with agents/zaps etc.
	11.	Reinvest profits into content + core features
	12.	Partner with creators in exchange for equity (1–20%) or revenue share (20–50%)
	13.	Keep surfacing new ideas from users + trends (use agent feature on pro Ideabrowser.com)
	14.	Build public-facing tools to drive top-of-funnel
	15.	Add modular pricing: free → $29 → $299 → $3K
	16.	Turn manual services into productized features
	17.	Build in public to attract users, partners, and acquirers
	18.	Bundle into an ecosystem, not just a single feature
	19.	Own the loop: audience → product → content → more audience
	20.	Run sprints on retention (fix that leaky bucket)
	21.	Backfill with AI agents before hiring ops roles
	22.	Test new channels with throwaway brands
	23.	Monetize the backend, sell data, leads, APIs if applicable
	24.	Have fun
	25.	Repeat. Build a portfolio
	26.	Share hires, tools, and infrastructure across products
	27.	Acquire underperforming products with distribution upside
	28.	Relaunch or bundle existing apps using your playbook
	29.	Create a holding-company brand people want to follow (this is exactly what I’m doing—practicing what I’m preaching)
	30.	Build long-term wealth with no outside investors and infinite spins
	31.	Cross-promote wins across your product ecosystem to drive flywheel growth
	32.	Create an internal idea-to-launch pipeline (every 30 days, something ships)
	33.	License or clone successful products into new verticals or geos
	34.	Recruit niche operators to run individual products for cash + upside/profit share
	35.	Build once, compound forever… audience, code, and trust all stack
