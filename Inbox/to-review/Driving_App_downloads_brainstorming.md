# Driving App downloads brainstorming

I’d like to create an executive up to 5 page White paper that summarizes some great ideas as well as some forward, thinking new technologies and tried in true psychological principles when it comes to shopping related to building deeper relationships with customers at Walmart Canada as an executive at Walmart Canada with a primary focus on driving app downloads. This white paper should consider several factors like store only customers signing up for a walmart.ca account, customers that shop online only and just use the website to download the app customers that download the app to use the app in store, customers that use the app being incentivized to place their first scheduled weekly shopping pick up order for free pick up, customers that have only shopped online in the general merchandise areas to place their first weekly shopping order for free pick up, customers that regularly use free, pick up using the website to be encouraged to download the app, customers that use the app and use free pick up and have never tried delivery to start trying delivery potentially using a delivery pass incentive like a free trial, customers that are on free trial to make sure that they’re using the app, customers that are on free trial using the app to sign up for a paid membership. 

This is quite a complex set of requirements. Can you use a McKinsie style of breaking down the situation and problem to build a CEO level pitch to better understand this space and break it down into investment the thesis and hypotheses. Can you use facts that have been publicly published by McKinsey & Co. Boston, consulting group and Bane and Company? Can you take into consideration this is for Walmart Canada so learning as much from Walmart US and what has worked in Walmart US and is publicly available is very important. Leveraging ideas and technical solutions from Walmart. US, with respect to driving app, downloads and app usage, like the Walmart US store mode and all of the features within that capability like store, maps, and item finding like price checking, as well as encouraging deeper relationships with Walmart like their Walmart plus offerings, is very important to the Canadian executives. Also remember that Walmart is an every day low price retailer and so pricing gimmicks is not necessarily a priority for the executives. 

Can you also layer in wherever interesting and important the differences between Canadian customer behavior and global customer behaviors specifically western countries like Australia, United States, England, Germany as places that may have evolved in this space a lot earlier and there is an opportunity in Canada to close this gap and for Walmart to really play a leadership role in closing the gap in customer behavior Because there’s proof in other western countries that customers have moved in a specific direction or with specific behaviors use as many recent facts in this area as possible.

When you don’t have all of the facts from within Walmart Canada, please simply insert a placeholder, especially when there is a solid strategic rationale.

Can you rewrite this from the perspective that I am a product management leader within Walmart Canada and I am sharing this as my perspective on this topic and it is to be read by my chief growth officer, who is my boss’s boss, so use the right tone for that perspective and also don’t overdo the references to the consulting firms, simply take their best practices and embedded them into how you break down this problem and write the document in a very professional way
