# Planning documents rationalization

I had been building md files left right and centre‚Ä¶ but I wanted to clean these up into a folder for plans and only keep a best practice set of planning files that I wanted claude to be constantly referring to, adding to‚Ä¶ and using as the projects minimum set of planning files ‚Äî that can become a template to create new projects.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now let me look at one more UX/design planning document to understand those categories.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now I have a good understanding of the planning documents. Let me update my todo and analyze the themes to provide MECE
  recommendations.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Based on my analysis of the planning documents, I can see several overlapping themes and redundancies. Let me organize my
  thoughts to provide a clear MECE recommendation.

  Categories I'm seeing:
  1. Strategic/Business Planning (30/60/90 day plan, competition, positioning, strategic decisions)
  2. Product Requirements (PRD2, codex_PRD, the soul of the app, philosophy)
  3. Technical Architecture (Apple Intelligence, On-device AI, Voice Learning, Event Flow, Template System, Future Proof)
  4. Implementation/Execution (Master Coordinator, Implementation Master Plan, Implementation Roadmap, Day 1 Kickoff, Testing
   Strategy)
  5. UX/Design (codex_UX_improvements, OPAL redesign, Screen differentiation, Liquidglass)
  6. Marketing/Launch (App Store Listing, Positioning vs Competitors)
  7. Features/Capabilities (Adaptive Speaking Style Engine, Privacy Value Prop)

  There's significant overlap and many documents that could be consolidated. Let me create a MECE structure recommendation.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Based on my analysis of all 32 planning documents, here's my recommendation for a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively
  Exhaustive) structure that eliminates redundancy while preserving all essential planning information:

  Recommended Consolidated Structure: 7 Core Planning Documents

  1. PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md

  Consolidates:
  - the soul of the app.md
  - PHILOSOPHY_ALIGNMENT.md
  - strategic_decisions_summary.md
  - PRD2.md
  - codex_PRD.md
  - PRIVACY_VALUE_PROPOSITION.md

  Purpose: Single source of truth for product vision, philosophy, core differentiators, and strategic decisions.

  2. TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md

  Consolidates:
  - APPLE_INTELLIGENCE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
  - ON_DEVICE_AI_ARCHITECTURE.md
  - VOICE_LEARNING_ARCHITECTURE.md
  - EVENT_FLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md
  - TEMPLATE_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
  - FUTURE_PROOF_ARCHITECTURE.md
  - ADAPTIVE_SPEAKING_STYLE_ENGINE.md

  Purpose: All technical specifications, AI architecture, system design patterns, and future-proofing strategies.

  3. IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md

  Consolidates:
  - MASTER_COORDINATOR.md
  - IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_PLAN.md
  - IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
  - IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
  - DAY_1_KICKOFF.md
  - PLAN.md
  - PLAN_MODIFICATIONS_ONDEVICE.md
  - TESTING_STRATEGY.md
  - NEXT_STEPS.md
  - next_steps_brainstorming.md

  Purpose: Execution plan with phases, milestones, testing strategy, and current progress tracking.

  4. UX_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

  Consolidates:
  - codex_UX_improvements_plan.md
  - OPAL_UX_IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md
  - OPAL_REDESIGN_PROGRESS.md
  - SCREEN_DIFFERENTIATION_PLAN.md
  - LIQUIDGLASS_VISUAL_STARTER_PACK.md

  Purpose: Complete design system, UX patterns, visual guidelines, and improvement plans.

  5. BUSINESS_PLAN.md

  Consolidates:
  - 30_60_90_day_plan_2025.md

  Purpose: Business strategy, revenue targets, growth plan, and resource allocation.

  6. MARKET_POSITIONING.md

  Consolidates:
  - POSITIONING_VS_COMPETITORS.md
  - competition.md
  - APP_STORE_LISTING_AND_PRESS_KIT.md

  Purpose: Competitive analysis, positioning strategy, and go-to-market materials.

  7. FEATURE_SPECS.md (Optional - could be part of Technical Architecture)

  Purpose: Detailed specifications for individual features that don't fit elsewhere.

  Key Benefits of This Structure:

  1. No Overlap: Each document has a clear, distinct purpose
  2. Complete Coverage: All planning aspects are covered
  3. Easy Navigation: Clear where to find and update information
  4. Maintainable: Reduces update burden from 32 to 7 files
  5. Decision-Ready: Each document answers specific questions:
    - WHAT are we building? ‚Üí PRODUCT_STRATEGY
    - HOW does it work? ‚Üí TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE
    - WHEN/HOW to build? ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP
    - WHAT does it look like? ‚Üí UX_DESIGN_SYSTEM
    - HOW to make money? ‚Üí BUSINESS_PLAN
    - WHO are we competing with? ‚Üí MARKET_POSITIONING

  Migration Strategy:

  1. Start with IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP as it's already your command center
  2. Move content section by section, not file by file
  3. Keep original files in an "archive" subfolder for reference
  4. Add clear navigation headers to link between documents
  5. Establish ownership for each document

  This structure reduces cognitive load while ensuring no planning information is lost.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 Perfect! Now I have a clear understanding of:
  1. The current CLAUDE.md structure and its role
  2. The UX_IMPROVEMENTS.md tracking system
  3. The existing 32 planning files that need consolidation

  Let me create a comprehensive execution plan that:
  1. Details how to consolidate the 32 files into 5
  2. Updates CLAUDE.md to reference the new structure
  3. Maintains all the good practices (branching, testing, sub-agents)
  4. Makes it clear how Claude Code should use the new planning files

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

 Successfully consolidated 32 planning documents ‚Üí 5 MECE files:

  üìÅ New Structure:

  1. PRODUCT.md - Vision, features, competitive analysis
  2. TECHNICAL.md - Architecture, AI/ML, security
  3. DESIGN.md - UX/UI, design system, components
  4. EXECUTION.md - Roadmap, current status, active tasks (COMMAND CENTER)
  5. BUSINESS.md - Business model, growth strategy

  üîß Key Updates:

  - CLAUDE.md updated with clear navigation to 5-file structure
  - EXECUTION.md is now the starting point for all coding sessions
  - Sub-agent guidance improved with specific reference docs
  - Original files archived in plans/archive/ for reference
  - Full backup created in plans-backup-20250913/

  üìä Impact:

  - 84% reduction in planning files
  - Zero content loss - all information preserved
  - Clear MECE boundaries - no overlap between files
  - Template-ready for other projects
