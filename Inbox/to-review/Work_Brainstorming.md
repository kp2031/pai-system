# Work Brainstorming

I'm a senior director of a product management team in ecommerce. can you ask me questions to be able to help me with your brainstorming? 

1. a national omnichannel retailer in canada 

2. my team has 3 leads and each one of them have 2-5 team members 

3. digital marketing, post purchase experience (tracking, comms, self-serve tools), customer support (chat, voice, agent tools), membership/loyalty, account & payment security & fraud. 

4. reduction in contacts, average handling time, first contact resolution, number of members signed up on a free trial, number of members signed up for a paid membership, account takeovers, chargebacks, insult rates 

5. I want the team to get much better at articulating the problems they're solving for, the measurements that specifically measures the work they're doing as well as the final outcome metrics, i want my team to be able to build great product strategies, i want them to be able to convert their work into business value in terms of GMV or GMV equivalent (when you gross up a cost reduction to get an equivalent GMV value that it would require to make the same amount of profit)
