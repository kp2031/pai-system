# Shoutout for Ankit and Harini

I want to take a moment to recognize Ankit and Harini for their above and beyond support to our operations team in conducting a competitive analysis of omnichannel returns in Canada. Their proactive approach and attention to detail have been instrumental in identifying how we can simplify the returns process across both digital and physical channels, building trust with our customers. By reducing the hesitation to place orders online, their work will directly contribute to improved customer conversion and increased GMV. Thank you, Ankit and Harini, for your dedication and commitment to improving our customer experience to serve our customers.
