# Why to work on a 10 year project

1. Infrastructure investment: Supporting or creating lasting physical or social infrastructure that serves beyond your lifetime, like community gardens, libraries, or mutual aid networks.
2. Bridge building: Working to reduce destructive polarization by creating dialogue across divided groups, which future generations will view as essential to rebuilding cohesion.
3. Educational endowment: Contributing to knowledge systems that will outlast current institutions, through teaching, scholarship, or preserving crucial information.
4. Ethical precedent setting: Making difficult choices with awareness that they may become templates for future decision-making in similar circumstances.
5. Regenerative practices: Adopting ways of living that leave resources enhanced rather than depleted for future generations, whether environmental, cultural, or social.
