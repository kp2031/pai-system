# Prompt brainstorming using some best practices from YouTube 

**System Prompt (Optional, but good practice):**
You are an expert AI Project Management Assistant. Your goal is to help me refine an existing development plan for a suite of applications, ensuring it aligns with best practices for clarity, detailed task breakdown, and iterative execution, inspired by effective AI-assisted coding workflows.

**User Prompt:**

I have an existing step-by-step process, generated by an LLM, for building out a suite of interconnected applications. I need your help to refine this process to make it much more robust, actionable, and less prone to errors or misinterpretations during development.

Please review my current process (which I will provide below) and guide me in improving it by applying the following principles:

1.  **Product Requirement Document (PRD) Clarity & Foundation:**
    * For the overall suite AND for each individual application/major feature within it, help me ensure the **WHAT**, **WHY**, and **FOR WHOM** are crystal clear, as if we were creating a PRD suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement.
    * Identify any ambiguities in my current plan regarding scope, user stories, or core functionalities.
    * Prompt me with specific clarifying questions to fill these gaps (e.g., "For App A, you mention 'user authentication.' Could you specify the required methods like email/password, OAuth with Google, etc.? What are the key user flows after login?").
    * Encourage me to define success criteria for each app/major feature.

2.  **Detailed Task List Generation:**
    * Based on a clearer "PRD-like" understanding, help me break down each high-level step in my current plan into a highly detailed, sequential list of actionable sub-tasks.
    * Each sub-task should be small enough to be implemented and tested relatively independently.
    * The task list should be formatted clearly (e.g., using markdown with checkboxes, or numbered lists with sub-points).
    * Help me identify dependencies between tasks across different apps in the suite, if any.

3.  **Iterative Execution and Human-in-the-Loop Workflow:**
    * Advise on how to structure the refined plan to support an iterative development process.
    * For each task or small group of tasks, help me define clear "done" criteria.
    * Suggest points in the process where I (the human) should explicitly review the output/progress, provide feedback, or confirm completion before the "next step" (whether that next step is taken by me or an AI assistant) is initiated.
    * Help me think about how to manage the context (relevant files, previous decisions) effectively for each iterative step.

**My Current Step-by-Step Process for Building the Suite of Apps is:**

# Step-by-Step Claude Code Prompts for Heart Rate Monitor App

## Instructions

- Manages WCSession for both iOS and WatchOS
- Implements WCSessionDelegate methods
- For WatchOS: sends heart rate data to iPhone
- For iOS: receives and processes heart rate data
- Handles background transfers and file transfers
- Includes methods:
  - sendHeartRateData(_ entries: [HeartRateEntry])
  - syncAllData()
  - getConnectionStatus() -> Bool
- Provides retry logic for failed transfers
- Manages data queuing when iPhone is unavailable
```

**✅ Check:** WatchConnectivityManager.swift created for both targets

- Chart view toggle option
- Proper list performance for large datasets
- Empty state when no data available
```

**✅ Check:** History view shows list of measurements

### Prompt 6C - Chart Visualization
```
Create a HeartRateChartView using Swift Charts that:
- Displays heart rate over time as a line chart
- Shows different time periods (day, week, month)
- Includes heart rate zones (resting, elevated, high)
- Interactive chart with tap-to-see-details
- Smooth animations and proper scaling
- Handles empty data states gracefully
- Export chart as image functionality
```

**✅ Check:** Chart view displays heart rate trends

---

## Step 7: Data Synchronization

```

**✅ Check:** Testing framework in place

---

## Final Verification Steps

After completing all prompts:

1. **Build both targets** without errors
2. **Install on real Apple Watch and iPhone**
3. **Test heart rate collection** on Watch
4. **Verify data sync** between devices
5. **Test all UI interactions**
6. **Check background functionality**

- **Check Xcode console** for any errors or warnings
- **Review generated code** before moving to next step
- **Modify prompts** if you need specific customizations

Okay, this is a great "meta" request! You want a prompt that uses the learnings from the video to help you refine an existing step-by-step process that an LLM has already generated for building a suite of apps.
Here's a prompt you can use, incorporating those best practices:
**System Prompt (Optional, but good practice):**
You are an expert AI Project Management Assistant. Your goal is to help me refine an existing development plan for a suite of applications, ensuring it aligns with best practices for clarity, detailed task breakdown, and iterative execution, inspired by effective AI-assisted coding workflows.

**User Prompt:**

I have an existing step-by-step process, generated by an LLM, for building out a suite of interconnected applications. I need your help to refine this process to make it much more robust, actionable, and less prone to errors or misinterpretations during development.

Please review my current process (which I will provide below) and guide me in improving it by applying the following principles:

1.  **Product Requirement Document (PRD) Clarity & Foundation:**
    * For the overall suite AND for each individual application/major feature within it, help me ensure the **WHAT**, **WHY**, and **FOR WHOM** are crystal clear, as if we were creating a PRD suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement.
    * Identify any ambiguities in my current plan regarding scope, user stories, or core functionalities.
    * Prompt me with specific clarifying questions to fill these gaps (e.g., "For App A, you mention 'user authentication.' Could you specify the required methods like email/password, OAuth with Google, etc.? What are the key user flows after login?").
    * Encourage me to define success criteria for each app/major feature.

2.  **Detailed Task List Generation:**
    * Based on a clearer "PRD-like" understanding, help me break down each high-level step in my current plan into a highly detailed, sequential list of actionable sub-tasks.
    * Each sub-task should be small enough to be implemented and tested relatively independently.
    * The task list should be formatted clearly (e.g., using markdown with checkboxes, or numbered lists with sub-points).
    * Help me identify dependencies between tasks across different apps in the suite, if any.

3.  **Iterative Execution and Human-in-the-Loop Workflow:**
    * Advise on how to structure the refined plan to support an iterative development process.
    * For each task or small group of tasks, help me define clear "done" criteria.
    * Suggest points in the process where I (the human) should explicitly review the output/progress, provide feedback, or confirm completion before the "next step" (whether that next step is taken by me or an AI assistant) is initiated.
    * Help me think about how to manage the context (relevant files, previous decisions) effectively for each iterative step.

**My Current Step-by-Step Process for Building the Suite of Apps is:**

[PASTE YOUR LLM-GENERATED STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS HERE]

**Your Output Should:**
* Begin by asking any immediate, high-level clarifying questions about my current plan or the overall suite if the provided information is too vague to start the refinement process.
* Then, guide me through the three refinement areas above (PRD Clarity, Detailed Task List, Iterative Execution) by:
    * Pointing out specific weaknesses in my current plan.
    * Suggesting concrete improvements or re-phrasing.
    * Asking targeted questions to elicit the necessary details from me.
    * Proposing a more structured and detailed version of the plan, or a framework for me to fill in.

Let's work together to transform my current plan into a highly effective roadmap.

How to use this prompt:
 * Copy the entire text above.
 * Replace [PASTE YOUR LLM-GENERATED STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS HERE] with the actual process you have.
 * Input it into the LLM you want to help you refine the process.
This prompt essentially asks the LLM to act as a consultant, using the video's best practices as a framework to critique and improve your existing plan. It guides the LLM to ask you the right questions, much like the AI in the video asked clarifying questions to build the PRD.
