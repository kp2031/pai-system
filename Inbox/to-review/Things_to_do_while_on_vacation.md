# Things to do while on vacation 

- look at bank accounts to make sure the cashflow and current quantity in checking works for monthly expenses
- Look at portfolio to balance growth vs dividends for the next 6 months 
- Clean up Things 
- Discuss deeply with Pri - life design for next 10 years (child raising - what decisions will come up) and 10 years after that (early retirement phase / partial work)
