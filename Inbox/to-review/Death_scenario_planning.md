# Death scenario planning 

Scenario planning for the event of one partner passing away is an essential aspect of ensuring the surviving partner's security and well-being. Here is a table outlining various themes and sub-themes to consider:
|  Theme<br/> | Sub-Theme<br/> | Details<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  Legal Affairs<br/> | Wills<br/> | - Each partner should have a will that clearly outlines the distribution of assets and guardianship of dependents if applicable.<br/> |
|   | Power of Attorney<br/> | - Establish a durable power of attorney for finances and healthcare to ensure that one partner can make decisions on behalf of the other if they become incapacitated.<br/> |
|   | Living Wills and Advanced Directives<br/> | - Create living wills or advanced healthcare directives to document each partner's wishes regarding medical treatment and end-of-life care.<br/> |
|  Financial Planning<br/> | Life Insurance<br/> | - Obtain life insurance policies that can provide financial support to the surviving partner.<br/> |
|   | Emergency Fund<br/> | - Build an emergency fund to cover immediate expenses in the event of a partner's death, such as funeral costs and living expenses.<br/> |
|   | Joint and Separate Accounts<br/> | - Consider the structure of your bank accounts, ensuring access to funds for the surviving partner while also respecting individual wishes for separate assets.<br/> |
|  Estate Planning<br/> | Trusts<br/> | - Set up trusts, if necessary, to manage the distribution of assets to the surviving partner or other beneficiaries while minimizing tax implications.<br/> |
|   | Beneficiary Designations<br/> | - Regularly review and update beneficiary designations on retirement accounts, insurance policies, and other financial products to reflect current wishes.<br/> |
|  Emotional Support<br/> | Support Networks<br/> | - Build a support network of family, friends, and professionals (such as a therapist) to provide emotional and practical support during the grieving process.<br/> |
|   | Grief Counseling<br/> | - Consider pre-emptive measures like discussing the availability of grief counseling and support groups to help the surviving partner cope with loss.<br/> |
|  Practical Arrangements<br/> | Funeral and Burial Plans<br/> | - Discuss and document each partner's wishes regarding funeral arrangements, burial, or cremation to ease decision-making during a difficult time.<br/> |
|   | Digital Legacy<br/> | - Organize digital assets, including social media accounts, online banking, and digital properties, with instructions for access and management by the surviving partner.<br/> |
|  Communication<br/> | Open Discussions<br/> | - Regularly engage in open and honest discussions about each partner's wishes, fears, and preferences regarding end-of-life planning to ensure clarity and mutual understanding.<br/> |
