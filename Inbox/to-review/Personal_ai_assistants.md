# Personal ai assistants

Imagine I had a single VP of AI Agents working for me that I interact with, but that VP interacts with dozens of AI directors who interact and coordinate outcomes by working with hundreds of ai assistants that I create and have report to my director of assistants to help me get done what I want done.

 Can you make a super long and detailed, but simple to understand for someone just getting started a step-by-step guide of how I can build a personal AI infrastructure with a few areas of focus - 1. knowledge management (brainstorming, idea capturing, document production, google slides creation, blog posts creation, image generation, etc.), 2. Family & best friends management (spouse, kids, parents, siblings, best friends,  extended family) 3. Personal Financial planning, 4. Personal health planning (physical health, mental health), 5. entertainment & fun (capturing requests to read a book or watch a movie or watch a show, capturing requests to try different restaurants or cocktail bars, keeping track of places to visit, etc.), 6. Career (capturing education, personal interests, career goals, ambitions, current challenges working through, medium term challenges, current situations with conflict, positive relationships with peers, projects worked on, successes recognized, people management notes, ability to write up end of year reviews for team members and myself, capturing daily thoughts and actions, being able to convert my dailyâ€™s into a weekly or bi-weekly summary of what I should talk to my boss about), keeping track of and engaging with content from or directly with indirect mentors e.g. following Tim Cook, Cathie woods, etc.  as well as mentors you have in real life e.g. at work), if you think of other dimensions   ? 

Can you make it in a way that we use the best practices of Claude code and nested claude.MD files inside of folders and sub-folders ?
