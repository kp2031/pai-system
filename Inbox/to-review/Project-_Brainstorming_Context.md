I want to create a business that is my 10 year project that I consider to be my #1 career passion.

I have a personal purpose to serve the underserved population. 

The business should be profitable and serve a community of people seeing out growth and support.

This is a bit about me, what energizes me, and I want you to take this into consideration when helping me brainstorm how to structure what I want to create.

About me:
- I love spending time with my wife and kid
- I treat 7am-8am sacred for family time and 5pm-9pm
- I have a day job that takes my time from 8am-5pm
- I like to do meditation and exercises before 7am
- I can work consistently after 9pm on this business 

About the skills I feel I have that are better than most people:
- My ability to think strategically about problems
- My ability to articulate what is breaking down in a group collaboration setting
- My ability to facilitate groups of people to extract great ideas
- My ability to structure short executive summary presentations 
- My ability to format presentations so they’re easy to digest
- My ability to give coaching to my team members in a setting of <20 people
- My ability to facilitate executive decision making meetings of <20 people
- I love leading high performance small teams <10 people
- I love the idea of solving the problem at the root cause and then building a system around it to reduce the risk of that problem
- I love the idea of “productizing” or franchising what I do so the money I make isn’t tied to the hours I spend or my time
- I love the idea that I can use AI to give people that are underserved access to guidance, coaching, support that would only be reserved for high income and high net worth individuals 
- I love giving guidance to my team members about how they present in all audience sizes
- I love working with my team to craft presentations that are appropriate for the audience they’re giving it to
- I love the idea of using AI to automate the editing part of presentations
- I love the professional style of presentations made by companies like McKinsey, BCG and Bain
- I love the idea of taking my 20 years in retail and being able to help small retail businesses thrive
- I love the idea of distilling my 20 years of strategy, merchandising, e-commerce knowledge into something that can be sold independent of my time
- I love to mentor my team members in the theme of managing and leading high performance teams 
- I would love to spend a good portion of my time doing this in 5 years and then all my time doing this in 10 years
- I don’t need it to make super high amount of money, but if it did, that’s great, but my focus is to work on something meaningful, contribute to the world, cover my bills of ~$250k per year
