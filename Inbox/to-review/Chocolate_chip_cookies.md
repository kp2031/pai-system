# Chocolate chip cookies

Here’s a recipe inspired by Le Gourmand’s renowned chocolate chip cookies, known for their crispy edges and soft, gooey centers. This version incorporates both semi-sweet chocolate chips and dark chocolate chunks to emulate the rich chocolate experience.

**Ingredients**

**Component**	**Ingredients**

**Dry Mix**	- 2 cups all-purpose flour- 1 tsp salt- ½ tsp baking powder- ½ tsp baking soda
**Wet Mix**	- ½ cup plus 2 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature- 1¼ cups brown sugar- 2 large eggs- 2 tsp vanilla extract
**Add-ins**	- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips- 1 cup dark chocolate chunks

**Instructions**

	1.	**Prepare Dry Mix:**

	•	In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Set aside.
	2.	**Cream Butter and Sugar:**

	•	In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened butter and brown sugar. Beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.
	3.	**Incorporate Eggs and Vanilla:**

	•	Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
	•	Mix in the vanilla extract until fully combined.
	4.	**Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**

	•	Gradually add the dry mix to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Avoid overmixing to ensure a tender cookie.
	5.	**Fold in Chocolate:**

	•	Gently fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips and dark chocolate chunks, distributing them evenly throughout the dough.
	6.	**Portion Dough:**

	•	Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
	•	Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
	•	Using a cookie scoop or two tablespoons, portion the dough into balls and place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them at least two inches apart.
	7.	**Bake:**

	•	Bake in the preheated oven for 10–13 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown while the centers remain soft.
	8.	**Cool and Enjoy:**

	•	Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

**Additional Tips**

	•	**Chilling the Dough:** For enhanced flavor and texture, consider chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking.
	•	**Storage:** Store cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.
