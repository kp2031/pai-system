# Okay, this is a great way to refine the focus! Starting with a web…

Okay, this is a great way to refine the focus! Starting with a web application that takes an uploaded slide deck or text document and aims to produce a 10-slide executive summary is a smart MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
Let's break down your approach and tools:
1. Using AI Coding Tools (like Cursor) with No Prior Coding Experience:
 * The Power: Tools like Cursor, which integrate AI deeply into the coding environment, are revolutionary. They can write boilerplate code, translate natural language to code, explain existing code, and help debug. For someone starting from scratch, this can feel like a superpower and dramatically lower the initial barriers.
 * The Reality Check:
   * You're Still the Architect: While the AI can lay the bricks (write code), you need to design the house (the application's logic, user flow, and features). You'll need to tell the AI what to build, piece by piece.
   * Learning Curve: You'll inevitably learn coding concepts as you go, because you'll need to understand what the AI generates, why it works (or doesn't), and how to ask for changes. This is a good thing!
   * Debugging: AI-generated code isn't always perfect. You'll encounter bugs, and while the AI can help you fix them, understanding the problem often requires some foundational knowledge.
   * Specificity is Key: The more precise your instructions to the AI ("Create a Supabase Edge Function that triggers on a new file upload to the 'slides' bucket, downloads the file, and logs its name"), the better the results.
 * Is it Possible? Yes, it's more possible now than ever before. But it will be a significant learning journey. Be patient with yourself and the process.
2. Supabase for Your Backend:
 * Is Supabase Good Enough? Yes, absolutely. Supabase is an excellent choice for this project, especially if you're already using it.
   * Authentication: Handles user sign-up, login, and profiles easily.
   * Database (PostgreSQL): Perfect for storing user data, information about uploaded documents, the generated summaries, and subscription status (if you add payments later).
   * Storage: Ideal for handling the uploaded slide decks/documents and storing the generated 10-slide summaries.
   * Edge Functions (Deno/TypeScript): This is where your core logic will live. When a user uploads a file, an Edge Function can be triggered to:
     * Access the uploaded file from Supabase Storage.
     * Process the document (this is the complex part).
     * Call an AI (like OpenAI's API, Anthropic's Claude API, etc.) to get the 10-slide summary structure.
     * Potentially use another tool/library to format this structure into a new slide deck.
     * Save the result back to Supabase Storage and update the database.
 * Supabase vs. Firebase:
   * Both are excellent "Backend-as-a-Service" platforms.
   * If you're already on Supabase and comfortable, there's no compelling reason to switch to Firebase for this specific task. The core challenges (document processing, AI integration) will be similar on both platforms.
   * Firebase uses NoSQL (Firestore) primarily, while Supabase uses PostgreSQL. For your use case, either is fine.
   * Firebase Cloud Functions use Node.js, Python, etc., while Supabase Edge Functions use Deno (which runs TypeScript/JavaScript). You'll find plenty of AI assistance from Cursor for TypeScript.
 * Supabase vs. AWS:
   * AWS is incredibly powerful but also significantly more complex to set up and manage, especially for a newcomer. It offers more granular services (e.g., AWS Lambda for functions, S3 for storage, Cognito for auth, DynamoDB/RDS for databases).
   * For your current stage, AWS would likely be overkill and introduce unnecessary complexity.
   * One AWS service that could be relevant down the line is AWS Textract, which can extract text and data from documents. However, you can call services like this from a Supabase Edge Function if needed, rather than moving your whole backend.
   * Stick with Supabase for now. It provides the right balance of power and ease of use for your project.
3. The Core Challenge: Document Processing and Slide Generation
This is where the real work lies, and where you'll lean heavily on AI (both Cursor for writing code, and an LLM API for the summarization):
 * 

Step 1: File Upload (Frontend to Supabase Storage)
   * Your web app (which Cursor will help you build the HTML, CSS, JS for) will have an upload form.
   * Users select a file.
   * The frontend code uploads this file directly to a designated bucket in Supabase Storage.
 * 

Step 2: Text Extraction (Supabase Edge Function)
   * An Edge Function triggers when a new file arrives in the storage bucket.
   * If it's a text document (.txt, .md): Relatively easy to read the content.
   * If it's a .docx (Word): You'll need a library that can run in a Deno environment to extract text (e.g., mammoth.js or similar, if compatible). Cursor can help find and implement this.
   * If it's a slide deck (.pptx, Google Slides, Keynote):
     * .pptx (PowerPoint): Libraries like pptx-js (JavaScript) or calling an external API/microservice might be needed. Cursor can help write the code to use such a library.
     * Google Slides: Requires using the Google Slides API. This involves setting up API keys, OAuth for user permission (if they link their Google account), and making API calls. Cursor can help structure these calls.
     * .key (Keynote): This is the toughest. There are very few reliable cross-platform libraries. The most common approaches are:
       * Asking users to export to PDF or PPTX first.
       * Using a third-party conversion API (adds cost).
       * (Advanced, Mac-only server setup): Using AppleScript to control Keynote.
         For an MVP, I'd recommend initially supporting PPTX and text, and perhaps asking Keynote users to convert.
 * 

Step 3: AI Summarization (Supabase Edge Function calling an LLM API)
   * Once you have the raw text from the document/slides, your Edge Function will send this text to a powerful Large Language Model (LLM).
   * Important: Cursor itself is an AI coding assistant. For the content summarization, you'll likely need to make an API call to a service like OpenAI (GPT models), Anthropic (Claude models), or Google (Gemini models) from your Supabase Edge Function.
   * You'll need to sign up for an API key from one of these providers.
   * Your prompt to the LLM will be critical: "Based on the following text, generate content for a 10-slide executive summary. For each slide, provide a concise title and 3-5 key bullet points. Ensure the summary captures the main arguments/points of the original document."
   * The LLM will return a structured text response (e.g., JSON) with the content for your 10 slides.
 * 

Step 4: Generating the Output Slide Deck (Supabase Edge Function)
   * This is another complex step. You have the content for 10 slides from the LLM. Now you need to put it into an actual slide deck file.
   * Option A (Simpler MVP): Initially, just display the 10-slide summary (titles and bullets) as formatted text on a webpage. This proves the core summarization works.
   * Option B (Full MVP): Programmatically create a .pptx file.
     * You can use libraries like pptxgenjs (a popular JavaScript library for creating PowerPoint files) within your Supabase Edge Function.
     * Cursor can help you write the code to take the LLM's output and use pptxgenjs to create a new presentation, add 10 slides, and populate them with the titles and bullet points. You can start with a very basic template.
     * Save this generated .pptx file back to Supabase Storage.
 * 

Step 5: Display/Download (Frontend)
   * The web app notifies the user that their summary is ready.
   * Provide a link for them to download the generated slide deck (or view the text summary).

Recommendations:
 * Start with the Simplest Possible Thing:
   * Focus on text document uploads (.txt) first.
   * Aim to have the AI generate the 10-slide summary structure as text output displayed on the webpage.
   * This gets your core pipeline (upload -> Supabase function -> LLM call -> display result) working.
 * 

Then Add .pptx Generation: Once text-in, text-out works, tackle generating an actual .pptx file from the LLM's structured text output using a library like pptxgenjs.
 * 

Then Add .docx and .pptx Input: Expand to allow .docx and .pptx uploads, figuring out the text extraction for each.
 * 

Keynote/Google Slides Later: These are more complex; save them for after you've proven the model with easier formats.

You're on a good track with Supabase. The main journey will be learning to effectively instruct Cursor to build out these processing steps, especially the interaction with external libraries and LLM APIs from within Supabase Edge Functions. It's ambitious but achievable with persistence!
