# Strategic OKR Framework for Walmart Canada’s Digital Customer Support

**## Strategic OKR Framework for Walmart Canada’s Digital Customer Support**
**
**
**Introduction:**Walmart Canada’s digital customer support ecosystem spans multiple channels – from self-service options like the Help Centre, chatbots, IVR and voice bots, to live support via chat or phone agents, as well as the internal tools that empower those agents. This strategic OKR framework groups initiatives into three customer-centric categories: **Automated Self-Service**, **Assisted Live Support**, and **Agent Enablement & Insights**. Each category has a clear Objective and measurable Key Results (OKR) aligned with improving Net Promoter Score (NPS) and operational excellence. We also detail 10–20 tactical initiatives per category to leverage modern capabilities (Generative AI, conversational analytics, personalization at scale) in driving these outcomes. The goal is to deliver faster resolutions, higher customer satisfaction, and more efficient operations – crucial in a high-volume retail context where many inquiries (e.g. order status checks) can be handled automatically _medium.com_. By executing this OKR-driven strategy, Walmart Canada can **empower customers**, **delight them with timely support**, and **continuously improve service quality**, all in alignment with enterprise goals.
**## 1. Automated Self-Service**
*This category covers all ****customer self-service**** touchpoints, including the online Help Centre knowledge base, FAQs, AI-powered chatbots on web or mobile, automated IVR phone menus, and voice bots. The focus is on enabling customers to get instant, accurate answers and complete simple tasks on their own, 24/7, without needing a live agent.*

**## Objective & Key Results (OKR) – Automated Self-Service**
**Objective:** **Deliver a world-class automated self-service experience** that empowers customers to quickly resolve their inquiries independently through AI-driven solutions, thereby boosting customer satisfaction and reducing live contact demand.
**Key Results:** (measured quarterly)
* **KR1: Self-Service Resolution Rate** – Increase the percentage of customer inquiries fully resolved through self-service channels (web, chatbot, IVR) from *X%* to *Y%*. This means more customers find answers without agent intervention, driving down call/chat volume. (Higher self-service success directly lowers operational costs while improving customer satisfaction _forrester.com_.)
* **KR2: Customer Satisfaction/NPS (Self-Service)** – Improve the Net Promoter Score (or CSAT) for digital self-service interactions by *Z* points. Customers should rate the ease and usefulness of self-service highly, reflecting a faster, hassle-free experience. (Well-designed self-service **increases customer satisfaction** and deepens engagement _forrester.com_ _forethought.ai_.)
* **KR3: Contact Deflection and Efficiency** – Achieve a *__%* reduction in live support contacts for issues addressed by self-service (e.g. deflect **N** calls per month to self-serve channels). This **call deflection** translates to faster answers for customers and improved agent availability for complex cases _cloud.google.com_.
* **KR4: Operational Excellence Metric** – Reduce cost-to-serve per customer by *__%* through automation. By deflecting common inquiries and optimizing IVR containment, resources are saved without sacrificing quality. (Effective self-service “delivers personalized engagement, increases satisfaction and **reduces operational costs by deflecting** common inquiries” _forrester.com_.)*(Note: Baseline values (X) and targets (Y, Z, etc.) should be defined based on current performance data. For example, if self-service resolution is 40% today, target 60%. If self-service NPS is +20, target +30, etc.)*

**## Key Initiatives – Automated Self-Service**
To achieve these outcomes, the product team will execute a range of initiatives focused on improving knowledge accessibility, automating common tasks with AI, and personalizing the self-service journey. The following **initiatives (10–15)** are proposed:
|  **Initiative (Automated Self-Service)**<br/> | **Description & Tactics**<br/> |
|-----|-----|
|  **1. AI-Powered Knowledge Base Search**<br/> | Upgrade the Help Centre with a **Generative AI search** that can interpret natural language questions and surface the most relevant answers. This uses NLP to understand customer intents and phrasing, providing direct answers or helpful articles even if the query doesn’t exactly match article keywords. The result is quicker self-service resolution as customers more easily find what they need.<br/> |
|  **2. Dynamic FAQ & Personalization**<br/> | Leverage customer data to **personalize self-service content**. For example, show questions related to a user’s recent orders or store visits at the top of the Help Centre. Use **personalization at scale** so each customer sees relevant FAQs or troubleshooting tips (e.g. if they bought a TV, surface the “returns and warranty” info for electronics). This tailored approach makes self-service more effective and user-friendly _medium.com_.<br/> |
|  **3. AI Chatbot for 24/7 Instant Support**<br/> | Deploy an enhanced **AI chatbot (virtual agent)** on Walmart Canada’s website/app that can handle a broad range of Tier-1 inquiries (order status, refunds, store info, etc.). Using a **GenAI-driven conversational model**, the bot can understand complex phrasing and engage in multi-turn dialogues to resolve issues. It will be integrated with backend systems (order database, account info) to provide personalized, account-specific answers (e.g. “Where is my order?” -> bot gives real-time status). An always-available chatbot ensures **immediate support** for customers, improving experience and NPS _forethought.ai_.<br/> |
|  **4. Smart IVR & Voice Bot Upgrades**<br/> | Enhance the phone support IVR with **natural language understanding (NLU)**. Instead of rigid menus, allow callers to state their issue in their own words. Implement a voice bot (using the same conversational AI as the chatbot) that can handle common requests via speech (e.g. checking order status or store hours through the phone system). This will increase IVR containment (more callers self-serve in the IVR) and reduce the need to wait for an agent, thus lowering wait times and frustration _medium.com_.<br/> |
|  **5. Seamless Channel Transitions**<br/> | Ensure that if a customer cannot be fully helped by self-service, the transition to a live agent is **seamless and context-rich** _forrester.com_. For instance, the chatbot/IVR can transfer the chat or call to an agent along with the entire interaction history and customer info so far. This way, the customer doesn’t have to repeat themselves, and the agent picks up with full context. This initiative improves overall resolution times and customer sentiment (since repetition is a common complaint).<br/> |
|  **6. Conversational Analytics for Self-Service**<br/> | Implement **conversational analytics** on chatbot and IVR interactions to continuously improve the system. By analyzing transcripts where the bot failed or where users got frustrated, the team can identify knowledge gaps or misunderstood intents. These insights will drive updates to bot training data, new FAQ content, or IVR flow tweaks. Over time, this data-driven refinement increases the self-service success rate and customer satisfaction.<br/> |
|  **7. Expand Self-Service to New Tasks**<br/> | Identify the top 10 contact drivers (e.g. “Where is my refund?”, “How to change order?”) from support data and build **automated flows** for each. For example, create a self-service return initiation process on the Help Centre, or a chatbot flow to update an address on an order. By expanding the scope of what customers can do on their own, we further deflect routine queries. Each new self-service capability will be measured for adoption and success rate.<br/> |
|  **8. Proactive Support Prompts**<br/> | Use **AI to predict when customers need help** and offer assistance proactively. For instance, if a customer lingers on the “Order tracking” page or error page, trigger the chatbot to ask “Need help with your order?”. Similarly, send push notifications or emails with self-service guidance (like a how-to for common post-purchase questions). Proactive prompts can resolve issues before the customer decides to contact support, thereby improving NPS through a smoother journey.<br/> |
|  **9. Multilingual Self-Service Support**<br/> | Roll out self-service tools (help articles, chatbot, IVR) in both English and French (reflecting Canadian bilingual needs) using AI translation and localization. Ensure the chatbot’s **GenAI model** is trained to understand and respond in both languages. This initiative makes support more inclusive and convenient, potentially boosting NPS among francophone customers by offering help in their preferred language.<br/> |
|  **10. Self-Service Feedback Loop**<br/> | After each self-service interaction, prompt the customer for quick feedback (“Did this answer your question? [Yes/No]”). Use this feedback to calculate a self-service satisfaction score and identify content to improve. For instance, if an article is rated unhelpful frequently, update it using clearer instructions or **GenAI to rewrite** it more simply. This continuous feedback loop drives higher quality in help content and bot responses.<br/> |
|  **11. AI-Generated Knowledge Base Content**<br/> | Leverage generative AI to **expand and update the Help Centre content** quickly. Analyze support tickets and chat logs to find common questions not well-covered in current FAQs, then use GenAI to draft new knowledge articles or chatbot utterances for those topics (with human review for accuracy). This ensures the self-service knowledge stays up-to-date with emerging customer issues and reduces information gaps that lead to agent contacts.<br/> |
|  **12. Measure & Optimize Self-Service KPIs**<br/> | Establish a **dashboard for self-service metrics** – including usage, resolution rate, deflection rate, and satisfaction. Track these KPIs weekly. Use A/B testing for changes (like new bot replies or article layouts) to measure impact on containment and NPS. By rigorously measuring outcomes, the team can experiment and continuously optimize the self-service experience, driving towards the Key Result targets.<br/> |

*Rationale:* These initiatives collectively enhance the **availability, accuracy, and ease-of-use** of Walmart Canada’s self-service support. By integrating **Generative AI** and personalization, the Help Centre and bots become more conversational and context-aware, replicating a helpful in-store associate in digital form. This not only cuts down on wait times and **resolves issues faster**, but also improves customer sentiment – shoppers feel they can get help anytime and get back to their day. Effective self-service is more than just deflection; it **empowers customers with answers and advice that deepen their engagement with the brand, positively influencing satisfaction, retention, and advocacy ****_forrester.com_**. Furthermore, every issue solved through automation frees up agents to handle more complex needs, contributing to both **higher NPS and operational efficiency**.
**## 2. Assisted Live Support**
*This category encompasses ****real-time human assistance**** channels: live chat with agents, phone calls to contact center agents, and any other live dialogue (e.g. video chat or social messaging if applicable). It focuses on optimizing the ****experience and efficiency of live customer-agent interactions****. Even as self-service improves, many customers will still seek human help for complex or urgent issues – making it vital to deliver empathetic, swift, and effective live support.*

**## Objective & Key Results (OKR) – Assisted Live Support**
**Objective:** **Provide seamless and personalized live support experiences** that delight customers and earn their loyalty – ensuring inquiries handled by live agents are resolved quickly, competently, and with a human touch that boosts Net Promoter Score.
**Key Results:**

* **KR1: First Contact Resolution (FCR) Rate** – Increase FCR for live support channels from *X%* to *Y%* (i.e., the percentage of customer issues resolved on the very first chat or call, with no follow-up needed). Higher FCR means customers get their problem fully solved without bouncing around, which has a direct impact on loyalty – *research shows every 1% improvement in FCR can increase NPS by roughly 1.4 points* _sqmgroup.com_. This Key Result aligns agents around solving issues **right the first time**.
* **KR2: Live Support NPS/CSAT** – Achieve a live-support Net Promoter Score of *Z* (or improve it by *__* points). After agent interactions, customers should feel confident and satisfied enough to recommend Walmart. This reflects the quality of service (courtesy, knowledge, resolution) provided by agents. (Aim for NPS that is steadily rising, indicating our improvements in training, tools, and responsiveness are paying off in customer perception.)
* **KR3: Average Handle Time (AHT) Efficiency** – Reduce the average handle time for chats/calls by *__%* (e.g., from *n* minutes to *n-30 seconds* on average) **while maintaining high quality**. Shorter handle times mean customers get solutions faster and agents can assist more customers, contributing to both operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Efficiencies will come from better agent tools (not from rushing the customer), ensuring no sacrifice in empathy or effectiveness.
* **KR4: Response Speed and Service Level** – Improve responsiveness such that **90% of chats** are answered within *30 seconds* and **90% of calls** are answered within *20 seconds* (or similar SLA targets). Fast response is critical in live support – customers expect quick connection to a representative. Meeting these service levels consistently will enhance customer sentiment (nobody likes waiting on hold or in a chat queue). It also reflects back-end staffing and routing efficiency improvements.
* **KR5: Customer Effort** (optional) – Achieve a Customer Effort Score (CES) of *X* (e.g. a low score meaning easy experience) for live support interactions by reducing transfers and repetition. For instance, target that at least *95%*of issues are handled by the first agent without needing escalation or hand-off. A low-effort experience (customer doesn’t need to struggle or repeat themselves) tends to improve overall NPS as well.

**## Key Initiatives – Assisted Live Support**
The following **initiatives (10–15)** are aimed at enhancing the live support journey through better tools, training, and use of AI assistance. These will help agents resolve issues faster and personalize their service, ultimately improving FCR and customer satisfaction:
|  **Initiative (Assisted Live Support)**<br/> | **Description & Execution**<br/> |
|-----|-----|
|  **1. AI-Powered Agent Assist (Co-pilot)**<br/> | Deploy a **real-time AI assistant for agents** during live chats and calls. This “co-pilot” listens to the conversation (or reads the chat) and uses generative AI to suggest helpful information: relevant knowledge base articles, next-best actions, or even draft responses the agent can personalize. For example, as a customer describes an issue, the AI could fetch their order details and suggest a solution script. This reduces the time agents spend searching for answers and helps maintain consistency and accuracy in responses. (By reducing effort, agents can focus on empathy while the AI handles data lookup, speeding up resolution.)<br/> |
|  **2. Unified Agent Desktop**<br/> | Implement a **unified agent interface** that consolidates all customer information and tools in one screen. When a customer reaches a live agent, the agent should see order history, prior interactions (including what the customer tried in self-service), and relevant customer profile data immediately. This single pane of glass avoids agents toggling between systems and provides full context to personalize the interaction. It directly supports higher FCR and shorter handle times, as the agent has everything needed at their fingertips.<br/> |
|  **3. Context Continuity from Self-Service**<br/> | Integrate systems so that if a customer escalates from a chatbot or IVR to a live agent, the agent receives the **conversation history and customer input** that occurred in self-service _forrester.com_. For instance, the chat transcript or IVR selections pre-fill on the agent’s screen, and the customer is routed to the appropriate team. This initiative prevents customers from re-explaining their issue (a major factor in effort and frustration) and lets the agent dive straight into problem-solving, improving customer experience and speed.<br/> |
|  **4. Advanced Skills-Based Routing with AI**<br/> | Use AI-driven routing to match customers with the **best-suited agent** available. Leverage conversational analytics to detect the issue type or sentiment from the initial words a customer says to a bot/IVR, then route complex or sensitive issues to more experienced agents (or specific teams like billing vs. technical). Also incorporate language preference (English vs French) and even personality match where possible. Smart routing increases the likelihood of first-contact resolution and a positive interaction since the agent has the right expertise for that customer’s need.<br/> |
|  **5. Training in Empathy & Personalization**<br/> | Augment agent training programs to emphasize **personalized service** – using the data available to them to tailor the conversation. Also train on soft skills (empathy, active listening) especially when handling escalated or emotional customers. Role-play scenarios and share best practices for personalization (e.g., using the customer’s name, referencing their specific situation like “I see you’ve been a loyal customer for 5 years”). Personalized, caring interactions make customers feel valued, boosting NPS. Modern AI tools can help by analyzing past interactions to highlight where an agent could have been more empathetic, turning those into coaching insights.<br/> |
|  **6. Live Chat Enrichment (Multimedia & Product Info)**<br/> | Enhance the live chat platform to allow agents to share rich content: for example, push a **carousel of product images/links** in the chat if helping with product selection, or send a **map image** if guiding a customer to a store location. Similarly, on calls, enable agents with a quick way to send a follow-up SMS/email with links or answers discussed. This omni-channel enrichment makes the support more **interactive and helpful**. Customers can get detailed answers in one interaction (increasing FCR), and they perceive the service as high-touch and convenient.<br/> |
|  **7. Real-Time Sentiment Analysis & Alerts**<br/> | Utilize AI to perform **real-time sentiment analysis** on live interactions. For chats, analyze the customer’s tone or word usage; for calls, use voice analytics. If the system detects rising frustration or negative sentiment (e.g., customer sounds angry or types “This is not helpful!”), trigger an **alert for supervisor support or offer the agent on-screen tips** to de-escalate. This ensures timely recovery for at-risk interactions – potentially turning a detractor experience into a neutral or positive one. Keeping interactions positive will reflect in better post-chat NPS.<br/> |
|  **8. Streamlined Escalation Paths**<br/> | Design clear, fast escalation workflows for agents. If an issue can’t be resolved at Tier 1, empower agents to bring in a specialist or supervisor with minimal delay (e.g., an “expert on call” system or warm transfer). Also, equip agents with an **“exception handling” toolkit** – such as the ability to immediately issue a gift card or coupon for service recovery without manager approval for certain cases. Quick recovery actions can **surprise and delight** customers even when things went wrong, increasing their likelihood to recommend Walmart.<br/> |
|  **9. Optimize Agent Staffing & Schedules**<br/> | Use forecasting analytics (possibly AI-based) to predict contact volumes and ensure **proper staffing levels** for chat and phone support at all times. One initiative is to implement a “virtual queue with callback” for peak times – if hold times exceed 2 minutes, offer customers an automated callback when an agent is free. This reduces perceived wait and improves the experience. Meeting the **service level targets (KR4)** requires continual tuning of staffing, which this initiative addresses for operational excellence.<br/> |
|  **10. Quality Assurance with AI**<br/> | Expand the quality monitoring program by using AI to **analyze 100% of interactions** (calls/chats) for adherence to quality standards. Traditional QA only samples a few calls; with conversational AI, we can automatically check every interaction for compliance phrases, proper greetings, empathy signals, etc. For example, an AI QA tool can flag if the agent didn’t offer a required verification step or used an improper tone. This comprehensive QA ensures consistent service and identifies coaching needs faster. Over time, it uplifts overall service quality and thereby customer satisfaction.<br/> |
|  **11. Post-Interaction Follow-up & NPS Survey**<br/> | Implement an **automated follow-up** after each support interaction. For chat, pop a brief survey; for calls, send an SMS or email survey. Ask the NPS question (“How likely to recommend…”) or CSAT, and crucially, ask for any comment feedback. Use **AI to analyze the open-text feedback** for trends. If a customer had a poor experience (detractor), the system could automatically create a ticket for a recovery team to reach out and remedy the situation. This closing-the-loop not only may win back unhappy customers, but the feedback analysis guides improvement in agent training and processes. (One of the best ways to boost NPS is to actively address issues of detractors.)<br/> |
|  **12. Multi-Channel Consistency Initiative**<br/> | Ensure that regardless of channel (chat or phone), customers get **consistent information and policy application**. This might involve maintaining a single knowledge base that both chat agents and phone agents use, and syncing any updates across channels. Also unify the tone and style of support. A consistent experience prevents confusion (e.g. being told different things by chat vs phone), thereby reducing repeat contacts and building trust. This initiative could include periodic “mystery shopper” tests to ensure consistency, with results fed back into training.<br/> |
|  **13. Leverage **GenAI for Live Support Insights**<br/> | Use generative AI on historical chat and call data to identify patterns or suggestions to improve live support. For example, have AI cluster common customer complaints that required multiple contacts, and generate ideas on how to handle them in one go. Or use AI to simulate difficult customer scenarios for training purposes. By analyzing large volumes of conversation data, AI might highlight, say, that many callers ask about a new fee policy – prompting the team to better brief agents or clarify info on the website. These **conversational analytics** insights ensure the live support keeps evolving to address real customer needs effectively.<br/> |

*Rationale:* These initiatives aim to make every live interaction **efficient, empathetic, and empowered by technology**. By giving agents better tools (AI co-pilots, unified desktops, sentiment alerts) and training, we reduce customer effort and increase first-time resolution. Quick response and resolution are critical because customers equate speed with respect for their time. Equally, a caring personal touch is what drives promoters in an NPS sense. The use of **Generative AI in live support** serves not to replace agents, but to **augment their capabilities – reducing the mundane workload and surfacing insights – so they can focus on human connection.** Google’s experience with Contact Center AI shows that combining virtual agents and agent assistance yields **productivity gains and improved customer NPS** in contact centers _cloud.google.com_ _cloud.google.com_. In practice, this means customers get their problems solved in one friendly interaction, without long waits or transfers. Satisfied customers will reward Walmart Canada with higher loyalty and positive word-of-mouth, while the organization benefits from greater operational throughput and agent effectiveness (a key aspect of operational excellence).
**## 3. Agent Enablement & Insights**
*This category focuses on the ****tools, data, and processes that enable customer service agents to perform at their best****, as well as the insights gathered from support operations to drive continuous improvement. It covers internal agent-facing applications such as knowledge bases, workflow tools, analytics dashboards, and training programs. The goal is to empower agents with technology (including AI and automation) and to close the feedback loop by analyzing support interactions for strategic insights.*

**## Objective & Key Results (OKR) – Agent Enablement & Insights**
**Objective:** **Empower Walmart Canada’s support agents with cutting-edge tools and actionable insights** so they can deliver exceptional service efficiently, and use support learnings to continuously improve both customer experience and operational performance.
**Key Results:**

* **KR1: Agent Productivity Improvement** – Increase the number of inquiries handled per agent per hour by *__%*(without extending work hours or compromising quality). This metric captures efficiency gains from better tools and processes – e.g., if currently an agent handles 5 chats/hour on average, target 7 chats/hour. Improved productivity indicates that agents can resolve issues faster thanks to enablement (like quicker access to info, automated tasks, etc.).
* **KR2: Reduced Onboarding/Training Time** – Reduce new agent training time by *__%* (e.g., from 4 weeks to 3 weeks to reach full competency). Faster ramp-up means tools (like AI guidance, intuitive knowledge systems) are making agents proficient sooner. Generative AI assistance can **“reduce time-to-proficiency and improve agent performance” ****_cloud.google.com_**, so new hires reach expert-level service quicker – an operational win that also ensures customers get competent service even from newer agents.
* **KR3: Agent Satisfaction (eNPS)** – Improve the internal eNPS or agent satisfaction score by *__* points. Happy, well-equipped agents tend to deliver better customer experiences. This KR checks that our enablement efforts are positively impacting agent morale (e.g., through surveys about their tools and workload). A high agent satisfaction often correlates with better service quality for customers and lower turnover.
* **KR4: Knowledge Accessibility & Usage** – Achieve a *__%* increase in the usage of the knowledge base/tools (e.g., track queries or clicks in the knowledge system per agent per day, aiming for an increase as agents rely on it for quick answers). Also target that *90+%* of knowledge searches yield a helpful result. This indicates our knowledge management is effective, which should reflect in faster call resolution and consistency.
* **KR5: Insights-to-Action Cadence** – Establish a process where **100% of months/quarters include an “insights review”** from support data, yielding at least *N* actionable recommendations for improvement (such as process changes or product fixes). Essentially, ensure that support analytics (NPS drivers, common complaints, root cause analysis) are formally analyzed and lead to improvements. The outcome might be measured by number of improvements implemented, or reduction in repeat contacts for the issues that were addressed. This KR ties the “Insights” part of this category to real business impact – closing the loop so that problems revealed in support get fixed upstream, boosting customer satisfaction long-term.

**## Key Initiatives – Agent Enablement & Insights**
To reach these goals, initiatives will modernize the agent’s workspace and harness data from interactions. Below are **initiatives (10–15)** focused on tooling, AI integration for agents, and analytics processes:
|  **Initiative (Agent Enablement & Insights)**<br/> | **Description & Plan**<br/> |
|-----|-----|
|  **1. Unified Knowledge Hub with AI Search**<br/> | Build a **modern knowledge management system** that agents can query in natural language. This entails consolidating FAQs, product info, policy docs, and past resolved tickets into one repository. Implement a **GenAI-powered search** that understands questions and can even provide direct answers or concise summaries (rather than just matching keywords). For example, an agent could type or ask, “How do I process a return for online grocery orders?” and get a step-by-step answer instantly. This dramatically cuts down time spent hunting for information, thus improving handle time and agent confidence.<br/> |
|  **2. Agent “Copilot” for After-Call Work**<br/> | Extend the AI co-pilot concept to handle administrative burden. After a call or chat, agents typically write case notes or summarize the issue resolution. Deploy an AI tool that can **auto-generate call summaries** and update the ticket with key details (agent can verify/edit). Also, automate follow-up emails to customers based on templates, where appropriate. By automating post-interaction tasks, agents save several minutes per case – boosting productivity (KR1) and reducing cognitive load.<br/> |
|  **3. Integrated Contact Center Dashboard**<br/> | Provide team leaders and agents with a **real-time dashboard** showing key support metrics and goals. This should include live NPS or CSAT scores, FCR rate, backlog, etc., as well as individual agent performance stats (like their personal FCR, average handle time, etc. vs target). Making data visible helps agents self-correct and stay focused on outcomes. Additionally, display gamified elements or recognition (e.g., “5-star customer feedback shoutouts”) to keep agents motivated. An informed and motivated agent workforce is crucial for both satisfaction and efficiency.<br/> |
|  **4. AI-Driven Training and Coaching**<br/> | Personalize agent development using AI. For example, use conversation analytics to identify each agent’s improvement areas (one may need to work on empathy, another on product knowledge). Then have the system **recommend training modules or even simulate practice conversations** with an AI that mimics customers. This could be an interactive coach that gives real-time feedback. Also implement an **agent coaching bot** that can answer agents’ questions about policy or provide tips when an agent is unsure how to handle something. By tailoring training and providing just-in-time support, agents become proficient faster (supporting KR2) and feel more supported (supporting KR3).<br/> |
|  **5. Empowerment Tools & Process Simplification**<br/> | Review and improve internal tools with a focus on **agent experience (AX)**. Identify frequent pain points in agents’ workflow (too many forms? slow system logins? repetitive manual steps?) and fix them. This might involve introducing RPA (robotic process automation) for repetitive tasks or simplifying the UI of the agent CRM. Also increase the scope of what front-line agents can do without escalation – for instance, give them a “single-click” tool to refund an order or match a price within certain limits. Removing friction in the agent’s job directly translates to faster service and less frustration, improving both productivity and agent satisfaction (KR1, KR3).<br/> |
|  **6. Continuous Knowledge Improvement Loop**<br/> | Set up a formal **knowledge review process**: each week or month, analyze which help articles or internal knowledge pages are most viewed or have low success (perhaps via agent feedback or repeated customer questions indicating confusion). Use those insights to update the content. Also allow agents to flag if an article was not helpful or if they had to find info elsewhere. Perhaps create an “AI Knowledge Analyst” that monitors all queries agents make and if it fails to answer some, it alerts content authors to create or improve an entry. This keeps the knowledge base fresh and reliable, ensuring agents always have correct answers.<br/> |
|  **7. Conversational Analytics for Insights**<br/> | Deploy advanced **analytics on call and chat transcripts** to extract trends and root causes. For example, use text mining to find spikes in mentions of “delivery delay” or a product name. Set up a pipeline where these insights are reviewed by a cross-functional team (product, operations, support) monthly. If, say, many calls are about a confusing return policy, that insight can drive a simplification of the policy or better communication on the website. By mining 100% of interactions, Walmart Canada can proactively address issues **upstream**, reducing future contact volume and improving customer experience _sqmgroup.com_ _sqmgroup.com_. (This supports KR5 by ensuring insights lead to action.)<br/> |
|  **8. Voice of the Customer (VoC) Program**<br/> | Enhance the VoC program by incorporating data from NPS surveys, customer comments, and social media into the insight generation. Use **AI sentiment analysis** on all feedback channels to gauge customer sentiment and key pain points. Regularly share these insights with the product and store teams. For instance, if many customers comment that “the app checkout crashes,” that’s flagged to IT to fix. Ensure a feedback loop so that when improvements are made (e.g., a bug fix or a policy change due to support feedback), agents are informed – which also boosts their morale knowing their inputs drive change.<br/> |
|  **9. Agent Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing**<br/> | Introduce a platform or regular forum for agents to share tips and tricks with each other. For example, an internal community or chat group where agents can post “I found a great way to explain X to customers” or ask “Has anyone dealt with scenario Y?”. Encourage **peer learning** and capture the best solutions into the official knowledge base. This initiative leverages the collective intelligence of the support team and can be facilitated by an internal social tool or Q&A system (possibly with AI to highlight good answers). It improves consistency and gives agents a voice in improving processes.<br/> |
|  **10. Agent Well-being and Balance Initiatives**<br/> | To improve agent satisfaction (KR3) and sustain high performance, invest in well-being. This can include smarter scheduling (using workforce management software to ensure appropriate breaks and avoid burnout), as well as providing tools like an AI-based “stress detector” that can suggest a break if an agent had a series of tough calls. Also consider rotating roles or offering development paths so agents feel a sense of progression. A supported and engaged agent will naturally deliver better service. This initiative recognizes that **operational excellence** isn’t just about hard metrics, but also about maintaining a healthy, engaged workforce.<br/> |
|  **11. GenAI Integration for Internal Support**<br/> | Similar to customer-facing bots, create an **internal AI chatbot** for agents that can answer their questions about processes or retrieve specific data quickly. For example, an agent could ask this internal bot, “How do I apply a manual discount for a customer?” or “What’s the escalation email for delivery issues?” and get an immediate answer. This reduces dependency on asking supervisors or combing through documents, saving time. By using generative AI on internal documents and past Q&A, the bot can provide quick guidance, especially useful for new agents still learning the ropes.<br/> |
|  **12. Measure Impact and Iterate**<br/> | Continuously measure the impact of these enablement initiatives on both agent performance and customer outcomes. For instance, track if the **AI summary tool** (initiative 2) is saving X minutes per case, or if the **knowledge hub** (initiative 1) usage correlates with higher FCR. Also survey agents after new tool rollouts to gather feedback. Use this data to refine tools (maybe the AI suggestions need tweaking, or additional features are requested by agents). This iterative approach ensures the investments in enablement are actually translating to the desired results in productivity and service quality.<br/> |

*Rationale:* In this category, the strategy is about creating a **supportive, data-driven environment** for the people at the frontlines of customer service. By harnessing modern AI capabilities internally, Walmart Canada can transform the agent experience: agents will spend less time on tedious tasks and searching for information, and more time engaging with customers and solving problems. As Google Cloud notes, generative AI allows a shift from purely “agent offload” to also **boosting agent productivity and proficiency** _cloud.google.com_. Equipping agents with instant knowledge and AI assistance means even complex issues can be handled faster and more consistently, feeding back into higher FCR and customer satisfaction. Moreover, treating every customer interaction as a source of learning (through analytics and VoC) ensures the organization **learns and adapts** – fixing root causes of issues and tailoring services to customer needs. This creates a cycle of improvement: agents armed with insights deliver better service, which improves NPS, which in turn generates more promoter feedback and fewer complaints over time. By focusing on agent enablement and insights, Walmart Canada not only improves operational KPIs but also fosters a culture of excellence and innovation in customer care.
