**## RehearSmart Progress Update & Strategic Roadmap**
*[Duration: 10 minutes]*

Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining today's critical update on RehearSmart and our path forward. We're here to align on where we are, where we're going, and how we're going to revolutionize the way professionals prepare for their most important moments.
Let me start with why we're building RehearSmart. Every day, millions of professionals face high-stakes presentations—pitching to investors, presenting to boards, teaching critical concepts, or leading crucial meetings. And here's the uncomfortable truth: most of them are underprepared. Not because they don't care, but because they lack the tools to practice effectively. They rehearse in front of mirrors, record themselves on phones without feedback, or worse, they wing it. The result? Missed opportunities, lost deals, and unrealized potential. We're changing that narrative.
Our vision with RehearSmart is audacious yet simple: create an AI-powered rehearsal studio that fits in your pocket. Think of it as having a world-class speaking coach available twenty-four-seven, providing instant, objective, multimodal feedback that transforms nervous presenters into confident communicators. We're not just building another app—we're creating a movement called "Be Better Offline" that champions real-world, face-to-face excellence in an increasingly digital world.
Now, let's talk about our current reality and the progress we've made. We've completed our foundational research phase, validating our core assumptions through extensive market analysis. The data is compelling. Studies show that seventy-five percent of people experience public speaking anxiety, and virtual reality research demonstrates that structured practice with feedback can reduce this anxiety by up to forty percent. We've identified our core technology stack, partnering where it makes sense—using OpenAI's Whisper for transcription, MediaPipe for pose estimation, and building our own proprietary feedback algorithms on top.
Our minimum viable product is taking shape. The core rehearsal platform now allows users to input their scripts, record practice sessions, and receive basic audio analysis. We can accurately detect filler words with ninety-two percent accuracy, measure speaking pace within two words per minute, and provide real-time transcription that users are already finding valuable. But this is just the foundation. The real magic happens when we layer on the additional intelligence we're building.
Here's what's coming in the next three months that will set us apart. First, we're integrating video analysis using computer vision to assess body language, eye contact, and facial expressions. Imagine getting feedback not just on what you said, but how you looked while saying it—did you maintain eye contact seventy percent of the time, or just forty? Were your gestures open and engaging, or closed and defensive? Second, we're adding physiological monitoring through smartwatch integration. Users will see their heart rate patterns during practice, identifying exactly which moments trigger anxiety spikes. This isn't just data—it's actionable insight that helps speakers understand and conquer their nerves.
But perhaps most exciting is our AI coach, Orion, which we're beta testing next month. This isn't just another chatbot. Orion will analyze your complete performance data—speech patterns, body language, stress indicators—and provide personalized coaching conversations. It can role-play difficult Q&A scenarios, help you restructure confusing segments, and even provide real-time motivation when you're struggling. Early tests show users engaging with Orion an average of three times per practice session, seeking specific advice on everything from reducing filler words to managing pre-presentation anxiety.
Now, I need to address the elephant in the room: competition. Yes, Yoodli exists. Yes, Orai has users. And yes, traditional coaching firms aren't going away. But here's our differentiation, and it's significant. While Yoodli focuses primarily on speech analysis and Orai on voice coaching, we're building a complete ecosystem. We're the only platform combining speech analysis, body language assessment, physiological monitoring, AI coaching, and eventually, human expert support in one integrated experience. Our competitors are features—we're building a comprehensive solution.
Let's talk traction and validation. Since our closed beta launched six weeks ago, we've onboarded two hundred fifty users, with thirty-eight percent recording at least three practice sessions in their first week. Our early net promoter score is fifty-two, which is exceptional for a beta product. Users are reducing their filler words by an average of forty percent after five sessions. One user, a startup founder, told us RehearSmart helped her close a two-million-dollar funding round by improving her pitch delivery. Another, a sales director, credits us with helping his team increase close rates by fifteen percent through better presentation skills.
The market opportunity is massive and growing. The global corporate training market is worth over three hundred billion dollars, with communication skills training representing roughly twelve percent of that. But we're not just targeting corporations. Individual professionals spend over four billion annually on personal development, with public speaking consistently ranking in the top three skill areas. Our total addressable market, conservatively estimated, exceeds fifteen billion dollars globally.
Here's our go-to-market strategy for the next six months. We're launching with a freemium model—basic features free forever to drive adoption, premium features at twenty dollars monthly for individuals, and custom pricing for teams. We're partnering with organizations where our users already congregate. We're in advanced discussions with two Toastmasters districts for pilot programs. Three startup accelerators have expressed interest in providing RehearSmart to their cohorts. And we're building relationships with corporate learning and development departments who see the value in scalable, data-driven presentation training.
Revenue projections are conservative but promising. Based on our current conversion rate of eight percent from free to paid, and assuming we reach five thousand users by month six, we project twenty-five thousand in monthly recurring revenue. Add enterprise pilots, and we're looking at fifty thousand MRR within twelve months. But revenue isn't our only metric—we're tracking improvement outcomes, user engagement, and building a community that will become our greatest growth engine.
Let me be clear about our technical roadmap and innovation pipeline. Phase one, which we're completing now, establishes core recording and basic analysis. Phase two, launching next quarter, adds video and physiological monitoring. Phase three introduces our AI coach and human expert network. Phase four, targeted for month twelve, brings enterprise features, team analytics, and API access for integration with corporate learning management systems. We're also exploring edge computing to enable offline practice and enhanced privacy—imagine conducting secure practice sessions on a plane or in a hotel room without internet connectivity.
Our partnership strategy is equally ambitious. We're not trying to build everything ourselves. We're partnering with wearable manufacturers for biometric integration, with content creation experts for presentation design services, and with certified speaking coaches who will eventually offer premium human coaching through our platform. This isn't about replacing human coaches—it's about augmenting them, making quality coaching accessible to millions who could never afford traditional services.
Now, funding and resources. We've been bootstrapping deliberately, proving product-market fit before seeking external capital. Our burn rate is currently ten thousand monthly, with six months of runway from personal investment and early revenue. We're preparing for a seed round in Q2 next year, targeting one-point-five million to accelerate development, expand our team, and invest in user acquisition. But we're only raising when we have undeniable traction—this discipline keeps us focused on what matters: user value.
The team we're building is exceptional. We have deep expertise in machine learning, with our technical lead coming from a computer vision background at a major tech company. Our head of product spent five years at an edtech unicorn. Our advisory board includes a former Toastmasters International board member, a venture partner focused on future-of-work investments, and a cognitive scientist specializing in performance anxiety. We're not just building technology—we're assembling domain expertise that ensures we solve real problems effectively.
Risk mitigation is built into our strategy. Technical risk? We're using proven models and APIs initially, building proprietary technology only where it provides clear differentiation. Market risk? We're validating every feature with users before full development. Competitive risk? Our integrated approach and community focus create defensibility. Privacy risk? We're GDPR compliant from day one, with options for on-device processing coming soon.
Here's what success looks like in twelve months. Ten thousand active users, with at least thirty percent practicing weekly. Average improvement metrics showing fifty percent reduction in filler words, thirty percent improvement in pacing consistency, and twenty percent reduction in measured anxiety indicators. A sustainable business with one hundred thousand in monthly recurring revenue. And most importantly, a growing community of professionals who credit RehearSmart with transforming their communication skills and advancing their careers.
But let me zoom out and share the bigger vision. RehearSmart isn't just about better presentations—it's about human potential. In a world where AI threatens to automate many jobs, the ability to communicate effectively, to inspire, to lead—these become the ultimate differentiators. We're not building technology to replace human connection; we're building it to enhance human expression. Every user who conquers their fear, who delivers their message with clarity and confidence, who gets that promotion or closes that deal—they become part of our story, our movement.
The immediate action items are clear. Engineering team: complete video analysis integration by end of month. Product team: finalize Orion AI coach beta and recruit fifty beta testers. Marketing team: launch our content strategy with weekly blog posts showcasing user success stories and speaking tips. Business development: close at least one enterprise pilot and two organizational partnerships. Everyone: use the product daily, become our own best case studies, and remember that we're not just building features—we're enabling human transformation.
I'll leave you with this thought. Five years from now, when someone prepares for the most important presentation of their life—whether it's a startup pitch, a keynote speech, or a life-changing job interview—we want RehearSmart to be their first thought, their trusted companion, their secret weapon. We're not just building a product; we're democratizing excellence in human communication.
The path ahead is challenging but clear. We have the vision, the technology foundation, and the early validation. Now it's about execution, iteration, and relentless focus on user success. Let's build something that matters. Let's help millions of people be better offline.
Thank you. Questions?
