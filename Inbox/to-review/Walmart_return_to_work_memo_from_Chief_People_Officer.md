Walmart return to work memo from Chief People Officer 

Memo that Donna Morris, Walmart’s chief people officer, sent Walmart employees below:
***
It has been a little over four years since we faced the global pandemic that reshaped our lives in many ways, including our ways of working. In February 2022, we made the decision to bring Home Office associates back into our campus offices. We believe that being together, in person, makes us better and helps us to collaborate, innovate and move even faster. We also believe it helps strengthen our culture as well as grow and develop our associates.
