**## RehearSmart Progress Update & Strategic Roadmap**
*[Duration: 3 minutes]*

Good morning everyone. Let's align on where RehearSmart stands and where we're headed.
The problem is clear: millions of professionals face high-stakes presentations unprepared, lacking effective practice tools. They lose deals, miss opportunities, and underperform. We're changing that with RehearSmart—an AI-powered rehearsal studio in your pocket, available twenty-four-seven, transforming nervous presenters into confident communicators.
Current status: Our MVP is live. Users can input scripts, record practice sessions, and receive audio analysis. We detect filler words at ninety-two percent accuracy, measure speaking pace, and provide real-time transcription. Two hundred fifty beta users are already seeing results—reducing filler words by forty percent after five sessions. Our net promoter score is fifty-two, exceptional for a beta.
What's coming next quarter changes everything. Video analysis for body language and eye contact. Smartwatch integration for anxiety monitoring—users see exactly when their heart rate spikes. And Orion, our AI coach, providing personalized feedback and role-playing difficult scenarios. This isn't just features—it's a complete ecosystem no competitor offers.
Speaking of competition—Yoodli does speech, Orai does voice, traditional coaches cost hundreds per hour. We're the only platform combining speech analysis, body language assessment, physiological monitoring, and AI coaching in one integrated experience. Our differentiation is integration.
The market opportunity exceeds fifteen billion dollars globally. Corporate training is three hundred billion, with communication skills being twelve percent. Individual professionals spend four billion annually on development, with public speaking in the top three priorities.
Our go-to-market strategy is executing now. Freemium model: basic free, premium at twenty dollars monthly, enterprise custom pricing. We're partnering with two Toastmasters districts, three startup accelerators, and multiple corporate L&D departments. Revenue projection: fifty thousand monthly recurring revenue within twelve months based on current eight percent conversion rates.
Technical roadmap is phased. Phase one—core recording—complete. Phase two—video and biometrics—next quarter. Phase three—AI coach and human experts—month six. Phase four—enterprise features and API—month twelve. We're also developing edge computing for offline practice and enhanced privacy.
Our team combines deep ML expertise, edtech product experience, and domain knowledge. Advisory board includes a former Toastmasters board member and a cognitive scientist specializing in performance anxiety. We're bootstrapping with ten thousand monthly burn, six months runway, planning seed round Q2 next year at one-point-five million.
Success metrics for twelve months: ten thousand active users, thirty percent practicing weekly, fifty percent filler word reduction, hundred thousand monthly recurring revenue, and a thriving community of professionals transforming their careers through better communication.
Here's the bigger vision: In an AI-dominated future, human communication becomes the ultimate differentiator. We're not replacing human connection—we're enhancing human expression. Every user who conquers their fear, delivers their message clearly, advances their career—they're part of our movement.
Immediate priorities are clear. Engineering: complete video integration this month. Product: launch Orion beta with fifty testers. Marketing: weekly success stories and speaking tips. Business development: close one enterprise pilot, two partnerships. Everyone: use the product daily, become our best case studies.
Five years from now, when someone faces their most important presentation—a crucial pitch, keynote, or interview—RehearSmart will be their trusted companion, their secret weapon. We're democratizing excellence in human communication.
The path is clear. We have the vision, technology foundation, and validation. Now it's execution. Let's help millions be better offline.
