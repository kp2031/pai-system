# Claude Code - redesign

Claude Code - redesign 

 I've created a comprehensive 5-phase execution plan for the Opal-inspired Liquid Glass redesign of RehearSmart. The plan
  is structured to methodically transform the app's visual design while preserving all functionality.

  Plan Highlights:

  Phase Structure (3-4 weeks total):

  1. Foundation (3-4 days) - Design tokens, materials, animations
  2. Components (4-5 days) - Build 15+ reusable Liquid Glass components
  3. Screens (5-6 days) - Redesign all app screens systematically
  4. Polish & Accessibility (3-4 days) - Ensure AA compliance, reduce motion/transparency
  5. Testing & Validation (2-3 days) - Device testing, bug fixes, documentation

  Key Features:

  - 70+ detailed sub-tasks with checkboxes for tracking
  - Time estimates for each task to aid planning
  - Risk mitigation strategies for performance and design challenges
  - Success metrics organized by priority (P0/P1/P2)
  - Accessibility-first approach with fallbacks for reduce motion/transparency

  Design System Implementation:

  - Complete token system from the spec (colors, typography, spacing)
  - Liquid Glass materials (Regular, Clear, Tinted) with specific blur/tint values
  - Opal aesthetic: all-black, high-contrast, minimal chrome
  - SF Pro typography with proper scales
  - Animation system with spring dynamics

  The plan ensures no functional changes while completely transforming the visual layer to match the premium Opal
  aesthetic. Each phase builds on the previous one, creating a solid foundation before moving to implementation.

  Ready to begin with Phase 1 whenever you're ready! ðŸš€
