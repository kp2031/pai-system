# Tips from a career coach 
![Tips from a career coach](images/Tips%20from%20a%20career%20coach.jpeg)

Here's a summary of the tips from the video:

| Tip | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Goal Setting | Set goals to have a clear target in sight. Split life into three broad domains: health, wealth, and relationships. Set 1-3 goals for each domain for the quarter. |
| 2. Ideal Week | Create an ideal week calendar to visualize how you want to spend your time. This helps to ensure that you are making time for your goals. |
| 3. Parking Lot for Goals | Create a parking lot or bucket list for potential goals that are not a priority right now. This helps to keep track of potential goals without overwhelming yourself. |
| 4. Identity-Based Goal Setting | Define an identity, values, and daily quests for each domain of life (health, work, relationships). This helps to embody the identity of the person you want to be in each domain. |
| 5. Daily Quests | Define one daily quest for each domain of life every morning. This helps to make progress towards your goals every day. |

Here are the identities the speaker chose for each domain:

| Domain | Identity |
| --- | --- |
| Health | Hawkeye (Avenger superhero) |
| Work | Young Charles Xavier (X-Men) |
| Relationships | Chuck (TV series character) |

The speaker also mentioned the use of a Slack channel for sharing daily quests with his team for accountability and community vibes.
