Stoic philosophy

The following 5 principles provide a roadmap to following the Stoic philosophy:
1. Manage your expectations and judgments
2. Be realistic about what you have the power to change
3. Understand the meaning of equanimity— and practice it
4. Call out your emotions for exactly what they are
5. Live in harmony with nature — particularly human nature

1. STOIC PHILOSOPHY: MANAGE YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND JUDGMENTS
Do you tend to have very high expectations or make unrealistic assumptions? Do you exaggerate your judgement about people or situations?
When there's a big gap between what you want or expect and reality, it causes anxiety, frustration, and discord. You can have dreams, hopes, and beliefs, but better that they are sensible.
Another way to manage expectations is to occasionally reflect on worst case scenarios using an exercise called negative visualization. 
When you are in a tricky situation think about both the best and worst outcomes, and you'll start conditioning yourself to handle the ups and downs in life.

2. STOIC PHILOSOPHY: BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE
If you exert a lot of energy trying to change people or circumstances that are out of your control, this tenet is for you.
There's a lot about life you have no ability to influence. However, there's much you can change (namely your own thoughts, habits and actions).
Western society — the U.S. in particular — has an obsession with winning and succeeding. In reality, there are things that you won't be able to do, even if you "put your mind to it".
Learn how to distinguish what's in your power and what's not. A good rule of thumb is to start with self.

3. STOIC PHILOSOPHY: PRACTICE EQUANIMITY IN NEGATIVE SITUATIONS
Equanimity means calm and composure and and speaks to a powerful concept within Stoicism called Apatheia which is central to the philosophy.
Humans have a built in fight or flight mechanism that triggers anytime there's a perceived threat. It works by riling up your emotions so you react instantly and intensely.
However, as we evolved to have more control over environment (and thus more safety and security) this mechanism has remained in place, causing us to overreact to situations that aren't life or death.  
With practice you can learn how to master this mechanism instead of allowing it to command you.

4. STOIC PHILOSOPHY: CALL OUT YOUR EMOTIONS FOR EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE
How often do you feel unsettled or disturbed about something but can't clearly articulate why? Probably more than you realize.
In the midst of adverse situations your thoughts are typically muddled by overpowering emotions, so it's easy to misinterpret what you are really feeling.
By calming down enough to name the emotion and it's underlying cause, you'll be better able to address the situation in an appropriate way. 
One unfounded myth of Stoicism is that practitioners seek to suppress emotions. But what they really do is recognize emotions and then put them in check so they don't cause damage.

5. STOIC PHILOSOPHY: LIVE IN HARMONY WITH NATURE — PARTICULARLY HUMAN NATURE
Ancient Stoicism was both a metaphysical and spiritual philosophy as they were immensely dedicated to understanding the nature of the universe and learning how to work with, not against, that knowledge.
Most importantly was acknowledging that humans are rational beings and should hone their thinking skills.
In general, if you seek wisdom you'll develop deeper insights about yourself and the world around you. You'll sharpen your intuition and replace impulse behavior with purpose, intention, and logic.
