# Ask Claude

Please answer each of these questions / explain each of these statements as if I’m only a couple weeks into coding, a beginner that is excited about learning coding using Claude code, and want to use these tips, and have a simple application idea for someone to be able to come to a website, type in the point of a presentation slide that they’re working on and the application gives 5 options for what the title could be?

1. The planning phase often benefits from creating GitHub issues or documentation that capture the proposed approach before implementation.
2. Implementation follows the planned approach with iterative feedback and verification. The tool supports test-driven development workflows where tests are written first, committed separately, and then used to guide implementation. 
3. The commit phase involves creating descriptive commit messages, generating pull requests with context-aware descriptions, and updating documentation as needed.
4. Advanced Claude Code usage leverages multi-agent workflows for parallel development streams.  This approach involves running separate Claude Code instances in different contexts, each handling specific aspects of larger projects. 
5. Git worktrees enable this parallel development by creating multiple working directories from the same repository. Developers can run Claude Code in each worktree simultaneously, handling feature development, code review, and test writing in parallel streams
6. Separate context proves beneficial for code review workflows where one Claude instance writes code while another reviews it independently. This separation often yields better results than having a single Claude instance handle both tasks.
7. Multi-agent coordination can occur through shared scratchpads or communication files, enabling Claude instances to coordinate work while maintaining separate contexts for specialized tasks.
8. Automated testing integration includes pre-commit hooks that run Claude Code for linting and formatting, CI/CD pipelines that leverage headless mode for automated fixes, and performance monitoring that tracks and optimizes application metrics.
9. Code review processes benefit from dedicated review commands that focus on security vulnerabilities, performance implications, test coverage, and adherence to project conventions. These automated reviews complement human review processes while ensuring consistent quality standards.
10. Error handling and debugging workflows include log analysis commands that identify patterns and bottlenecks, performance profiling that reveals optimization opportunities, and security auditing that checks for common vulnerabilities.
