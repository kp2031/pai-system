# Selection criteria

# Selec# tion # crite# ria

- Individual is low-performing in a role that another higher performing individual can easily move into 

- Individual is not able/willing to take on more work as we reduce team size and increase scope

- Skill set is easily findable in the contractor market e.g. levels 10-11

- Org can logically and reasonably absorb a reduction through prioritization of activities
