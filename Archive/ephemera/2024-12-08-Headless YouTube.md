# Headless YouTube

Gratitude
- Opposite of self interested / selfish
- In 5-10 different accents
- Using 5-10 culturally appropriate language
- Open people’s heart a bit about people that are a tiny bit different in some way
- Make 10 videos each for ten specific topics all with the same theme of openness - gratitude - generosity 
- Position the videos as 
	- something that you listen to often as a reminder over and over again 
	- Always connect one video to another - if you want to learn more about x (next video) tap here to continue your journey 
	- They should be like Seneca’s meditations 
	- Build a playlist to support a one-tap re-listening to all 10 videos
	- Request that if/when the video helps them feel a bit of gratitude and openness that they share with one person 

Use chat gpt to confirm these are the right 10 age groupings 
Use the exact same 10x10 format (videos x cultural references) to build the videos for kids aged 3-8, 8-13, 13-16, 16-20, 20-25, 25-35, 35-55, 55-65, 65-80, 80+ (mental maturity / mindset phase segments)

Make one set in a male voice and the other in a female voice
