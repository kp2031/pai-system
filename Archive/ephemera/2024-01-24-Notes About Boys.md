# Notes About Boys

Do what you can … no worries if nothing is done.  As long as the kids are safe and loved - we are happy! 

Whitby is always a gamble … so, we take our wins. 
Don’t stress on times, but know we appreciate all the effort! 

Also … again … 
THANK YOU!

Our kids are a lot, so we appreciate you even wanting to do this … truly!

**OHM**

Helpful tips … 

* JEALOUSY 
	* When we give priority or more attention to Pi, Ohm gets really jealous. And, we find it usually happens when we are in large groups with lots of adults that are paying more attention to Pi. At these times, you will notice Ohm will start to regress and act like a baby or become violent towards Pi. He’s acting out to get attention. Simply redirect him and give him attention (if you can), and it usually diffuses the situation. Also, taking him away from the space helps as well. 
	* It’s hard, but we try not to emphasize  … “You are the oldest! You should know better!” He is only 4 after all. We try to say things like, **“we take care of each other, we are brothers.” ** 
* BATHROOM: 
	* If he's playing and seems to forget about peeing, gently say, **"Ohmie, listen to your body. **If you need to go, I can keep you company." If he denies needing to go and says he's just dancing, remind him to pay attention to his body.
	* Another approach could be setting a timer for every 3 hours. When it goes off, Ohmie needs to go sit on the toilet, no exceptions.
	* Every time you're leaving the house, even for fun activities like playing in the snow, remind Ohmie to go pee before the adventure - tell him, he cannot go unless he goes pee. 
	* Ohmie manages going poo on his own, but he might ask dad for help cleaning. 
	* The trickiest thing with Whitby is going to be enforcing only using the bathroom upstairs and not Ba’s. Someone should go upstairs with him as the faucets are sometimes tricky to turn on. 
* LANGUAGE: 
	* Remember, **"if dirty things come out, sweet things can’t go in." **This includes avoiding words like "booty," "what the heck," or "stupid."
	* When on the toilet, he's free to use "potty words," but as soon as he's done, let's keep those words in the bathroom. **"Potty words stay in the potty."**

	* If he uses a rude or demanding voice, suggest, **"Let's rewind and be kind" **or propose **“want to try that again?” **or … **“let’s have a redo” **This gentle reminder usually helps him reevaluate and express himself more positively.
* FOOD: 
	* Ohmie eats well, so no need to force him to eat. He will eat when he is hungry. 
	* Remind him during dinner that it's time to eat, and let him know there won't be a snack after his bath. This will motivate him to eat a full dinner until he's satisfied. Once he goes upstairs, there's no coming down. After dinner, dessert is allowed, but it's always (a non-sugary) cereal with milk or yogurt. 
	* Avoid sugary foods/drinks after 4 pm. If he naps, he can have one sugary treat right after, but if he doesn't nap, it's best to skip sugary snacks altogether. In the morning, sugary treats are okay

ROUTINE: 
	
	Morning:
	* Around 7:00 am: Ohmie will wake up on his own. He can independently brush his teeth and change into fresh clothes.
	* Breakfast follows after getting ready.

	Afternoon:
	* Around 12:00 pm: If Ohmie doesn't want to nap, encourage him to do a quiet activity without screens. If he naps, ensure it doesn't go beyond 3:30 pm to maintain a reasonable bedtime.

	Evening:
	* Around 5:30 pm: Dinner time

	Wind Down:
	* Around 6:00 pm: Start winding down with a bath, followed by brushing teeth. If one of the grownups can brush his teeth after him in the evening (that would be nice). 
	* Read a book together.

	Bedtime:
	* Around 7:00 pm: Ideally, he should be in bed. If he didn't nap, he may fall asleep easily; if he did however, bedtime might be pushed to 7:30 pm, but not much later. 

**Pi**

Helpful tips … 

*  I apologize in advance for whatever Pi does this weekend. 
* He likes to hit/throw things when he’s frustrated - so remind him **“gentle hands” **or **“you can be frustrated, but you cannot hit or you cannot trow things.”**
* He also is very mischievous and likes to do something to get your attention and then giggles or laughs. Try to be as firm as you can … as Mom/Dad/Ba don’t say anything because he starts crying. And just say … **“it’s okay to cry, it’s not okay to throw your food”** or whatever he is doing that is not okay. Don’t let him get away with things though, especially when he hurts others. Remind him that he cannot hurt others or snatch things without asking. 
* On another note, Pi is in a funny phase where he tries to communicate but because he cannot fully, he gets frustrated easily. It’s tricky. 
* Also, he likes sticking his fingers in peoples noses, ears or eyes. It’s hilarious … but also the worst!

ROUTINE: 

	Morning 
	* Pi wakes up every morning around 7am, drinks milk, and brushes teeth (needs supervision to avoid lengthy brushing).
	* Change his diaper but keep him in pajamas to prevent mess while eating.
	* Breakfast in the high chair or booster to avoid creating a mess.

**
**
	NAP 1
	* Usually between 9-9:30am  Nap in the crib, waking up around 11ish. Allow him to wake up on his own.
	* Longer nap if he takes more time to fall asleep.

**
**
	NAP 2
	* Usually between 1:30 pm - 2:00pm
	* Optional second nap 
	* Skip if not asleep by 3:00 pm.
	* Wake up by 4pm LATEST
	* Currently doing two naps due to not feeling well

**
**
	Flexible Lunchtime:
	* Pi eats well; let him guide the amount he eats.
	* Lunch timing may vary based on nap schedule.
	* Two snacks scattered throughout the day.

	Evening 
	* Around 5:30pm - Dinner time.
	* Dessert after dinner: cereal and milk or cereal and yogurt.

**
**
	Wind Down:
	* Around 6:00 pm: Start winding down with a bath, followed by brushing teeth (supervision needed)
	* Read a book together.

	Bedtime:
	* Around 7:00 pm
	* Ask Siri: play rain sounds (make sure it’s loud so he can’t hear outside)
	* Ensure a darkish room, pacifier on his sleep sack.
	* Hold him briefly (3-4 minutes), let him settle on your shoulder, then place him in the crib.
	* Allow 15 minutes for any crying; he'll likely settle on his own. Avoid going back into the room once you leave.
