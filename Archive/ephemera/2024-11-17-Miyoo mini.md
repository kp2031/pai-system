5. **Install Onion OS on Your Miyoo Mini**:
	* Insert the MicroSD card into your Miyoo Mini.
	* Power on the device; the installation will begin automatically.
	* Follow any on-screen prompts. Once installation is complete, the device will prompt you to press a button to turn off. _GitHub_

6. **Add Game Files (ROMs) and BIOS Files**:
	* Connect the MicroSD card to your computer.
