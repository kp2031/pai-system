**
**Pre-Day 1: Preparation Before Official Start**
**
**
**1. Secure Early Alignment with Key Stakeholders:**

**2. Gather Intelligence:**

* **Perform a Stakeholder Analysis:** Identify all key stakeholders, including the international teams in California and Bangalore, India. Map out their interests, levels of influence, and potential concerns regarding the merger of the digital experience teams.
* **Research the Technology Landscape:** Conduct a comprehensive review of the current technology stack, systems, and ongoing projects. Pay particular attention to the international components that will require collaboration.

**3. Plan Your Entry:**

* **Design Your 90-Day Roadmap:** Outline a detailed 90-day plan (like this one) that you can adjust as needed. Share this plan with your supervisor to ensure alignment and gain initial feedback.
* **Prepare Communication Strategies:** Develop a communication plan that outlines how you will engage with your new team, stakeholders, and international partners during your transition.

**Day 1-30: Transition and Assimilation**
**1. Establish Credibility and Build Relationships:**

**Relationship Building:**

Succession planning will be crucial for ensuring the team’s long-term success and stability, particularly as the organization grows and evolves.

**5. Set Up a Sustainable Review and Feedback Cycle:**

**Establish Regular Review Cycles:**

* **Quarterly Reviews:** Implement a formal review process to evaluate the progress of strategic initiatives and the effectiveness of team structures and processes. These reviews should involve key stakeholders, including international partners, and should be data-driven, focusing on measurable outcomes.
