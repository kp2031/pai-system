# Photo session notes

- Get to the location 30 minutes early to fix hair and outfit and to let me a warm-up and run around a bit
- Give him lots of candies & snacks 30 minutes before end bring 4-5 different snack options including case he doesn’t like some (eg he didn’t eat his bar)
- For the week before, practice… 123. Cheers.
- No treats during the photo session all of the before at least five minutes before
- Give him lots of snacks on the way there
