Hi Mike! Thanks for putting all this together. I’ve been reading about closures as well, it’s devastating hearing about the rising deaths. I’ve read about the closures due to damage of some historical sites in Marrakech. Hopefully all will be ok and there won’t be any after shocks. It’s all a bit concerning. 

Our arrivals are correct and we depart on the 17.

The dinner options for the 14/15 look good. I like the idea of breakfast provided by the villa, I don’t really want to do grocery shopping and then have to make breakfast every morning. Happy to contribute to any fees related to this. 

For the birthday dinner, can you please ask them to include vegetarian options as I don’t eat any meat. 

Thanks for putting all this together and getting us organized.
