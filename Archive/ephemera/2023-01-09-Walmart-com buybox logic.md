# Walmart.com#  buybox logic

There are several factors that can influence which seller's offer appears in the buy box on Walmart.com:

1. Price: The seller offering the lowest price for the product will generally win the buy box.
2. Availability: If a seller has the item in stock and can ship it within a reasonable amount of time, they are more likely to win the buy box.
3. Shipping cost: If two sellers have similar prices for the product, the one with the lower shipping cost may win the buy box.
4. Fulfillment method: If the product is eligible for two-day shipping with Walmart's ShippingPass program, the offer from a seller who is enrolled in ShippingPass may win the buy box.
5. Seller rating: Walmart.com uses a rating system to evaluate the performance of its sellers. Sellers with higher ratings are more likely to win the buy box.
6. Return policy: Sellers with more lenient return policies may have a better chance of winning the buy box.
7. Product availability: If a seller has a limited quantity of the product, they may be less likely to win the buy box.
8. Seller history: Sellers with a longer history of selling on Walmart.com, or who have consistently received positive feedback from customers, may be more likely to win the buy box.
9. Inventory management: Sellers who are able to accurately forecast demand and keep their inventory well-stocked may be more likely to win the buy box.
10. Order processing time: Sellers who are able to process and ship orders quickly may have an advantage in the buy box.
11. Customer service: Sellers who offer excellent customer service, including responsive communication and prompt resolution of any issues that may arise, may be more likely to win the buy box.
12. Product features: In some cases, the specific features of the product being offered may be considered when determining the winner of the buy box. For example, a seller who is offering a product with a longer warranty or more favorable return policy may have an advantage.
