Ketosis is a metabolic state in which the body, in response to a shortage of glucose, produces and burns ketones for energy. This can occur during periods of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, or intense exercise. Itâ€™s the principle behind the ketogenic diet. Ketosis can help with weight loss, improving mental clarity, and managing certain health conditions.

Autophagy is a natural process by which cells recycle their own components to provide necessary building blocks and clear out damaged or unnecessary components. It is often activated during periods of stress or nutrient deprivation, like fasting. Autophagy is thought to help with cellular health, longevity, and disease prevention.

While both processes can be induced by fasting, they are not the same thing. Ketosis is focused on the metabolic shift towards fat utilization for energy, whereas autophagy is a cellular cleaning process. Depending on the duration and nature of the fast, one might experience both states.
