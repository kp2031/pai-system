# Plant sources for various amino acids you get from animal protein / meat

3-5 options for each amino acid, along with the approximate quantity needed to match the animal source:

|  Amino Acid<br/> | Animal Source (Per Serving)<br/> | Plant Sources (Per Equivalent Amino Acid Qty)<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  Leucine<br/> | Chicken breast (100g): 2.4g<br/> | Lentils (200g): 2.4g, Black Beans (215g): 2.4g, Pumpkin Seeds (100g): 2.4g, Peanuts (150g): 2.4g<br/> |
|  Isoleucine<br/> | Eggs (2 large): 1.0g<br/> | Quinoa (150g): 1.0g, Chickpeas (200g): 1.0g, Almonds (120g): 1.0g, Brown Rice (250g): 1.0g<br/> |

**Notes:**
* The quantities listed for plant sources are approximations and can vary based on the type of plant food and its preparation.
* It's important to consider the overall balance of the diet when relying on plant sources to meet amino acid needs, as combining different plant foods can ensure a complete amino acid profile.
