There’s not much more I can share that you haven’t already thought about other than ways to channel the competitiveness in a positive way. There may be ways to teach and foster that competitiveness without it, becoming aggressive and hindering friendships, that they can form with their peers. It’s fascinating that some of the students do artwork outdoors. I’m sure you’re curious to understand how each of these different groups views, the other, if they are supportive of each other and their own interests or have a more antagonizing perspective on them. Which would be a new opportunity to encourage individual interests. Great area of focus!

I really enjoyed this assignment. I did find it difficult to not judge right away and come at it from the perspective that I have. It was difficult to not see how I can observe without leading to the outcome I wanted to get to. 

Also, the activity of giving peer feedback was not as easy as I thought it would be. I normally give feedback to people I know really well and can tailor it to that person. It was also challenging to separate my own bias for what I think is right, when learning about other peer’s observation plans and insights that they wanted to gather. This was really helpful.
