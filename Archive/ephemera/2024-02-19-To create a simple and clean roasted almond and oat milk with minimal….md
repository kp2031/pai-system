To create a simple and clean roasted almond and oat milk with minimal ingredients, you can follow this recipe. Including dates and salt for a hint of sweetness and enhanced flavor is a good choice.

| **Ingredients** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Almonds         | 1 cup, raw, preferably organic. Roast them to enhance the nutty flavor. |
| Rolled Oats     | 1 cup, organic if possible. They provide a creamy texture and a slight sweetness. |
| Dates           | 2-3 pitted, for natural sweetness. Adjust according to taste. |
| Salt            | A pinch, to enhance the overall flavor profile. |
| Water           | 4 cups, for blending. Use filtered water for the best taste. |

**Instructions**:

1. **Roast Almonds**:
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - Spread the almonds on a baking sheet in a single layer.
   - Roast for 10-15 minutes, checking frequently to avoid burning. Allow them to cool.

2. **Blend Ingredients**:
   - Combine the roasted almonds, rolled oats, pitted dates, and a pinch of salt in a blender.
   - Add 4 cups of water.
   - Blend on high until the mixture is very smooth, about 1-2 minutes.

3. **Strain the Mixture**:
   - Place a nut milk bag or a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl.
   - Pour the blended mixture through to separate the liquid milk from the pulp. Squeeze or press to extract as much liquid as possible.

4. **Taste and Adjust**:
   - Taste the milk and adjust the sweetness by adding more dates if needed, blending again.
   - If the milk is too thick, you can dilute it by adding a little more water.

5. **Store**:
   - Transfer the milk to a sealed container and store in the refrigerator.
   - Shake well before each use, as natural separation may occur.

**Notes**:
- This milk is best used within 3-5 days for the freshest taste.
- The leftover almond and oat pulp can be used in baking or added to smoothies for extra fiber.
