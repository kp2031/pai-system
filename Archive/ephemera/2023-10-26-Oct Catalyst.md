# Oct Catalyst

- I’d like to quickly share some of our tangible technology and financial updates and then an intangible one that’s not on the slide

- For our App 

- We are performing well, it has become the primary tool our core customers that shop us every week, multiple times a week use

- We launched several new capabilities on roadmaps that have many more capabilities to come - two of note are the Global Intent Centre project (shopping efficiency and saving time) and our Savings Tab project (for treasure hunting and saving money)

- For our Website, 

- We have now grand opened our new website to all Canadians with core capabilities

- And in the past month launched the features that we felt would help customers during the holiday Black Friday period, from specific Black Friday modules to make shopping more engaging, to financing options for customers to spread a big ticket gift purchase over multiple payments

- And as our site operation teams execute holiday experiences during Q4, 

- We are continuing to build the remaining priority features that will close the gap to our legacy website - after code freeze, in Jan - like facet shopping experiences for rollbacks
