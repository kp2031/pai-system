Map NPS on the customer journey - from a customers perspective 

Where are we offering a good / poor experience and what level of forgiveness is there e.g. poor experience (metrics vs US / MX) but does not impact customer NPS (some bad experiences, customers are more forgiving)

Map NPS moves based on Dx KPI moves â€¦ e.g. when we improve Search CTR by X bps, NPS goes up by Y bps
