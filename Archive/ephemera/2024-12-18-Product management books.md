Marty Cagan’s perspective on product manager accountability—focusing on the differences between "value" and "viability"—and how these contrast with feasibility and other team responsibilities.

Value is for the customer

viability is for the business
- Marketable 
- Generates profit
- Strategic fit 
- legal
- Compliance 

|  **Theme**<br/> | **Definition/Description**<br/> | **Primary Accountability According to Cagan**<br/> | **Examples of Activities**<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|  Value<br/> | Ensuring the product addresses real customer needs and delivers significant customer benefit. It’s about solving a meaningful problem in a way that customers want and will pay for.<br/> | Product Manager<br/> | *Market research, customer interviews, assessing product-market fit, measuring product impact on user satisfaction and revenue.*<br/> |
|  Viability<br/> | Ensuring the product is aligned with the broader business context, including compliance, financial sustainability, legal and regulatory requirements, and overall strategic fit. It’s about making sure the product makes sense from a business perspective.<br/> | Product Manager<br/> | *Checking legal constraints, assessing regulatory compliance, evaluating cost vs. profit margins, ensuring product supports business strategy.*<br/> |
|  Feasibility<br/> | Ensuring the product can be built and maintained with the given technical resources and constraints. It involves assessing if it’s technically achievable within time, budget, and resource limitations.<br/> | Engineering Team (with input from PM/Design)<br/> | *Technical prototyping, evaluating infrastructure requirements, estimating development timelines, ensuring scalability.*<br/> |
|  Usability<br/> | Ensuring the product is intuitive, user-friendly, and easy to interact with. It focuses on the end-user’s experience and making the solution accessible.<br/> | UX/UI Design Team (with input from PM/Engineering)<br/> | *User testing, wireframing, user experience design, continuous usability improvements.*<br/> |
|  Desirability (often coupled with Value)<br/> | Ensuring the solution is not only useful but also appealing, resulting in strong user adoption and retention.<br/> | Shared (primarily Product Manager & Designer)<br/> | *Branding, emotional design, personalization features, user journey mapping.*<br/> |

**Key Point:**

* According to Marty Cagan, product managers are primarily accountable for the **value** (does it solve the right problem for the user?) and **viability** (does it make sense for the business?) of the product.
* Engineers focus on **feasibility** (can it be built?), and designers focus on **usability** (is it easy and intuitive to use?).
* While these responsibilities overlap in practice, the accountability delineation ensures that all core risks—value, viability, feasibility, and usability—are adequately addressed by the product team.
