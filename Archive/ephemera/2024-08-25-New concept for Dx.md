# New concept for Dx

Three focus areas:

1. Experience design guidance (working with Ux research)

2. Experience development governance (working with product and engineering)

3. Experience monitoring and initiative prioritization (working with product) 

# Questions at monthly meeting

What are we working on that needs a new approach ?

What are we not working on, that the organization needs us to chip in, to get prioritized now ?

Is there anything from the NPS survey  (that has a wide-spread impact) that we need to prioritize now / faster ?
