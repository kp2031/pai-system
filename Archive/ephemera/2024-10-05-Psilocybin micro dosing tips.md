# Psilocybin micro dosing tips

_Top 10 tips for microdosing psilocybin:_

1. **Dosage**:
	* It's essential to start with a low dose. A typical microdose is around 0.1 to 0.3 grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms. Begin on the lower end and gradually adjust to find the optimal dose for them.
2. **Set and Setting**:
	* The mental and physical environment is crucial. Before microdosing, ensure they are in a positive mental state, feeling emotionally stable. Additionally, choose a comfortable, familiar, and safe environment where they can relax and minimize distractions.
3. **Schedule**:
	* Microdosing daily is not recommended. A typical schedule might involve one day on and two days off (like the Fadiman Protocol). This allows the body to avoid building a tolerance and ensures the effects remain noticeable.
4. **Mindset**:
	* Encourage them to be intentional with the process. They should have a clear understanding of why they are microdosing, whether it's for creativity, mood enhancement, or improving focus. The more mindful they are, the better they can track the benefits.
5. **Hydration and Nutrition**:
	* Staying hydrated and having a healthy meal before microdosing is important for overall well-being during the experience.
6. **Track Effects**:
	* Keeping a journal to document their experience can be very helpful. Have them note down their mood, any shifts in creativity, perception, or other effects they experience. Over time, this helps them understand how psilocybin is impacting them.
7. **Potential Side Effects**:
	* Even though microdosing involves small amounts, there can be subtle side effects. Some people may experience irritability, fatigue, or difficulty sleeping. If they notice any unwanted effects, adjusting the dose or frequency might help.
8. **Avoid Combining Substances**:
	* It’s best to avoid mixing psilocybin with other substances like alcohol or stimulants, as it could alter the intended effects or increase the chance of side effects.
9. **Be Patient**:
	* The benefits of microdosing are often subtle and build over time. It's important to be patient and avoid expecting immediate or dramatic changes.
10. **Integration**:
	* After each microdose, taking time to reflect and notice any subtle shifts in perspective or creativity is key. Encourage them to integrate these reflections into their daily life, reinforcing any positive changes they observe.

_Duration of effect:_

For someone under 200 lbs, taking a **100 mg (0.1 grams)** microdose of psilocybin, the effects are typically very subtle and may last between **4 to 6 hours**. However, since it’s a microdose, the person may not experience overt "psychedelic" effects like they would with a full dose. Instead, they might notice:
* A slight boost in mood
* Increased focus or creativity
* Heightened sensory perception (colors may seem a bit brighter)
* Enhanced emotional openness

The onset of effects generally occurs within **30 to 60 minutes** after ingestion, with the peak effects being very mild, lasting for about 2 to 3 hours, and then gradually tapering off. Most people return to baseline after 6 hours.
Keep in mind that individual experiences can vary based on factors like metabolism, sensitivity to psilocybin, and previous experience with the substance.
