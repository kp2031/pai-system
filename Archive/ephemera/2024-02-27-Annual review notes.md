Review of the past year

Ted supported the cross category team through challenging leadership situation with Vanessa in the first quarter leading to pivoting his structure to better support the cross category stakeholders.

You worked really closely with Franklyn and the category analysts in the details to improve reporting and collaboration with key stakeholders like Bniafer and her team.

Established a really strong, working relationship with Yatin and his team for weekly reviews on metrics validation, and testing of the output and collaboration on gaps and new metrics

Something I was very impressed with was how you reimagined the recruiting process for his contractors, using LinkedIn in a completely different way getting really talented individuals into the team.

You’ve done a great job engaging your team and the team’s stakeholders by surveying them for improvement opportunities. Doing this with your team has really taken your team’s engagement to the next level this past year, and additionally really move the needle with your stakeholders trust of him and his team and ability to work through challenges and delivery high quality reporting.

Future development opportunities 

Ted, your leadership has significantly impacted our digital experience team. Looking ahead, I see a few areas for further development and value creation:

Mentorship: 

Start a mentorship program within our team to develop leadership skills and team growth. This will help us adapt to constantly evolving tools and digital experience landscape.

Advanced Analytics and Technology:
Explore new analytics tools and approaches especially related to AI technologies to improve our data analysis. Collaborate more closely with the Dx Transform team as well as our Int’l tech teams via Eli’s team.

Stakeholder Engagement:
Continue organizing workshops for direct insight sharing with stakeholders. This will align your team’s effort and energy more closely with Walmart’s broader goals - which is very motivating - connecting their day to day with the bigger picture. I can help you with this. 

Professional Development:
Really encourage the team, and yourself, to engage in continuous learning. And take opportunities to share your and your team’s learnings across the Dx team. We can work together on the pace of sharing and what would helpful to the Dx ops teams. 

Overall, Ted had a really good year, building strong foundations always takes longer than expected, but Ted is well underway to having another great year with the team solidifying and new tools and processes being implemented. And with his focus on developing his and his team’s skills, I look forward to a great year working together with Ted. 

Thank you for all of your contributions to our teams and Walmart overall.
