Change by design by Tim Brown

The continuum of innovation - System of overlapping spaces instead of a sequence

Inspiration: The problem or opportunity that motivates the search for a solution

Ideation: The process of generating developing and testing idea

Implementation: the process of going from the project room to the market

"Fail early, to succeed earlier"
- IDEO

"The mark of a designer is a willing embrace of the constraints"
- Charles Eames

Prioritize the constraints in an order of importance

Feasibility: what is functionally possible within the foreseeable future

Viability: what is likely to become a part of a business's model

Desirability: what makes sense to people and for people
