The life-changing magic of tidying up - Marie Kondo

- What are your true values, what is most important to you in life 
- Choose the things that inspire joy when you touch them

————-

Six rules

**## 1. Commit yourself to tidying up**
The KonMari Method may seem a little hard. It does require time and effort. But, having picked up this book with the intention of at least making a good stab at seriously tidying up, please keep reading. And believe in yourself. Once you have made up your mind, all you need to do is to apply the right method.
**## 2. Imagine your ideal lifestyle**
Think about what kind of house you want to live in and how you want to live in it. In other words, describe your ideal lifestyle. If you like drawing, sketch out what it looks like. If you prefer to write, describe it in a notebook. You can also cut out photos from magazines.
You would rather start tidying right away, would you? That is precisely why so many people suffer rebound after tidying up. When you imagine your ideal lifestyle, you are actually clarifying why you want to tidy and identifying the kind of life you want to live once you have finished. The tidying process thus represents a huge turning point in a person’s life. So seriously consider the ideal lifestyle to which you aspire.
**## 3. Finish discarding first**
One characteristic of people who never seem to finish tidying up is that they attempt to store everything without getting rid of anything. When things are put away, a home will look neat on the surface, but if the storage units are filled with unnecessary items, it will be impossible to keep them organized, and this will inevitably lead to a relapse.
The key to success in tidying is to finish discarding first. You can only plan where to store your things and what to store them in once you’ve decided what to keep and what to discard, because only then will you have an accurate grasp of how much actually needs to be stored.
Thinking about where to store things, or worrying about whether you can fit everything in, will only distract you from the job of discarding, and you will never finish. That would be a terrible waste; so instead, consider any storage solutions made during the discarding process as temporary and focus all your attention on sorting the next category. This is the secret to getting the job done quickly.
**## 4. Tidy by category, not by location**
One of the most common mistakes people make is to tidy room by room. This approach doesn’t work because people think they have tidied up when in fact they have only shuffled their things around from one location to another or scattered items in the same category around the house, making it impossible to get an accurate grasp of the volume of things they actually own.
The correct approach is to tidy by category. This means tidying up all the things in the same category in one go. For example, when tidying the clothes category, the first step is to gather every item of clothing from the entire house in one spot. This allows you to see objectively exactly how much you have. Confronted with an enormous mound of clothes, you will also be forced to acknowledge how poorly you have been treating your possessions. It’s very important to get an accurate grasp of the sheer volume for each category.
**## 5. Follow the right order**

It is crucial not only to tidy by category but also to follow the correct order, which is clothes, books, papers, komono (miscellany), and finally, sentimental items.
Have you ever run across old photos while tidying and found that hours have passed while you were looking at them? This is a very common blunder, and it clearly illustrates the point of tidying in the proper order, which is designed specifically to help you hone your ability to distinguish what sparks joy. Clothes are ideal for practising this skill, while photos and other sentimental items are the epitome of what you should not touch until you have perfected it. 
**## 6. Ask yourself if it 'sparks joy'**
The criterion for deciding what to keep and what to discard is whether or not something sparks joy. When deciding, it’s important to touch it, and by that, I mean holding it firmly in both hands as if communing with it. Pay close attention to how your body responds when you do this. When something sparks joy, you should feel a little thrill, as if the cells in your body are slowly rising. When you hold something that doesn’t bring you joy, however, you will notice that your body feels heavier.
Remember that you are not choosing what to discard but rather what to keep. Keep only those things that bring you joy. And when you discard anything that doesn’t, don’t forget to thank it before saying goodbye. By letting go of the things that have been in your life with a feeling of gratitude, you foster appreciation for, and a desire to take better care of, the things in your life.

Start by discarding first - then storing in an organized way

People have difficulty discarding things due to...
- *Functional value* - things you can still use*
*
- *Informational value* - That contain helpful information
- *Emotional value* - Have sentimental ties
- *Rarity* - hard to replace

Best practice sequence when discarding things:
1. Clothes
2. Books
3. Papers
4. Miscellaneous
5. Mementos

**1.Clothing**
- Make sure you get all pieces of clothing you have in you own 
- Start with off-season clothes
- What you wear in the house does impact your self image, don't wear sweat pants - try not to downgrade close to loungewear

Tops - 160 Items on average 
Bottoms
Clothes that should be hung
Socks
Underwear
Bags
Accessories - scarves, belts, hats
Clothes for specific events – swimsuits
Shoes

**2.Books**

General – books you read for pleasure
Practical – cook books etc.
Visual – photograph collections
Magazines

- Get rid of all books that don't give you joy 

**3.Papers**

- Discard everything other than the three categories below

1. Needs attention - Currently in use, bills, etc.
2. Needed for a limited period of time - warrantee, contractual documents, etc.
3. Must be kept indefinitely - birth certificate, university degree, passport 

Tips: 
- Get rid of all the credit card statements
- Get rid of all user manuals
- Sort all warranties in one pile
- Rid of all paystub's except for previous four
- Letters and cards and sentimental things should be left to the end of the process when you deal with Momentos
- Get rid of all papers that don't need to be saved
- Get rid of all greeting cards or do not save for more than one year 

- Divide papers that you want to keep into two piles - papers to be saved and papers that need to be dealt with
- Letter is requiring a reply, forms that need to be submitted, articles I intend to read etc
- Keep all of these papers in one spot in the home never more than one spot - use of vertical organizer so they can all be seen and are not put into a stack
- For papers that need to be saved, sort them into two categories: infrequently used papers (Insurance policies, guarantees, leases) and more frequently used papers (outlines of seminars, newspaper clippings, etc)
- Put all in frequently used papers into single clear plastic files into a binder 

**4.Komono / miscellaneous**

- Only keep the items that spark joy
- CDs/DVDs
- Skin care products
- Make up
- Accessories
- Valuables - passports and credit cards
- Electrical equipment and accessories
- Household equipment, stationary and writing material, sewing kits, etc.
- Household supplies - medicine, detergents, tissues etc.
- Kitchen goods – spatulas, pots, blenders, etc.
- Other – spare change, figurines, etc.

Tips
- throw away all items that you feel right away our instantly disposable

Gifts/Presents
- does this present suit my taste?
- The true purpose of a present is to be received - presents aren't things, but a means to convey someone's feelings
- Coins in bags - get them to the bank asap - into my wallet 

**5.Mementos** 
- sentimental value 
- Ask yourself -- does it spark joy?

Don't send your keepsakes to your parents place 
- go to parents place and get rid of all my old stuff - and confront and process your past
- The purpose of the letter is to be enjoyed when received

Photos
- Put all photos in a pile from wherever they are all over the home
- They exist only to show a specific event or time 
- Does it inspire joy ?
- Usually 5 per day when traveling 
- Don't keep photos in a stack - put them into an album

A massive stockpile of simple stuff:
- Toothbrushes
- Pens 
- Markers
- Drawing pencils
- Notepads

**Designate a place for each thing** 
- the existence of an item without a home will attract random items around it  
- Your stock on hand will decrease because all similar items will be together - revealing your current inventory level

People only hold onto things for two reasons an attachment to the past and a fear of the future

Absolutely, the KonMari Method is a decluttering method developed by Marie Kondo. Here's a simple summary of the steps involved:

1. **Commit yourself to tidying up**: Start with a strong determination to tidy up and commit to the process.

2. **Imagine your ideal lifestyle**: Visualize the lifestyle you want to achieve after decluttering. This can serve as your motivation throughout the process.

3. **Discard items before organizing**: Before you start organizing items, start by getting rid of things you no longer need.

4. **Tidy by category, not location**: Unlike other cleaning methods, the KonMari Method suggests tidying by category, not by room. For example, instead of cleaning the living room, you would tidy all the books in the house at once.

5. **Follow the right order**: Kondo suggests the following order for tidying categories: clothes, books, papers, komono (miscellaneous items), and sentimental items. The idea is to start with the easiest category (clothes) and gradually move to the more emotionally charged items (sentimental items).

6. **Ask yourself if it 'sparks joy'**: This is perhaps the most well-known aspect of the KonMari Method. Hold each item in your hands and ask yourself, "Does this spark joy?" If the answer is no, thank the item for its service, then let it go.

7. **Organize your space**: After discarding, it's time to organize. Everything should have a place. The aim is to create a neat and tidy space that brings joy and peace.

8. **Tidy a little a day until it's done**: Don't rush the process. Instead, set aside a bit of time each day until your space is fully decluttered.

The method is not just about tidying, but about fostering a better relationship with your belongings and creating a lifestyle that brings joy and satisfaction.

Absolutely, here's how you can apply the principles from each chapter to your life:

1. **Why Can’t I Keep My House in Order?**: Start by acknowledging the need for change. Pay attention to your living space and understand the reasons why it's hard to keep it tidy. Make a commitment to tidy up.

2. **Finish Discarding First**: Start discarding items that no longer serve you. If an item doesn't bring you joy or serve a purpose in your life, it's time to let it go. This can be a powerful way to break free from the past and make room for new experiences and growth.

3. **Tidying by Category Works Like Magic**: Organize your belongings by category, not by room or location. Start with clothes, then move on to books, papers, and other items. This allows you to see exactly how much you have of each type of item, which can make it easier to decide what to keep and what to discard.

4. **Storing Your Things to Make Your Life Shine**: After you've decided what to keep, find a place for everything. Store items of the same type together so you always know where to find them. Avoid overcomplicating your storage system - simplicity is key. 

5. **The Magic of Tidying Dramatically Transforms Your Life**: Maintain the changes you've made. Recognize the positive impact that tidying up has had on your life and let it motivate you to keep your space tidy in the future. Regularly check in with your possessions and your space to ensure they continue to support your happiness and well-being. 

By following these steps, you're not only tidying your home, but also making space in your life for what truly matters to you.

Certainly, let's delve deeper into Chapter 3: "Tidying by Category Works Like Magic." Here are the five categories Marie Kondo recommends tidying in order, along with specific tips and actions for each:

1. **Clothes**: 
   - Collect every single piece of clothing you have in one place. 
   - Touch each item and ask yourself if it sparks joy. If it does, keep it. If it doesn't, thank it for its service and discard it. 
   - Once you've sorted all your clothes, you can start organizing them. Marie Kondo recommends folding most items and standing them upright to save space. For hanging items, arrange them so that the line along the bottom slopes upward—it creates an uplifting feeling.

2. **Books**: 
   - Gather all your books in one place.
   - Hold each one in your hands and decide if it sparks joy. 
   - Remember that the purpose of a book is to be read. If you have books that you've kept for years with the intention to read and still haven't, chances are you never will. It might be time to let them go. 
   - For the books that spark joy, arrange them in a bookcase or on a shelf. 

3. **Papers**: 
   - Kondo suggests discarding all papers unless they are: currently in use, needed for a limited period of time, or must be kept indefinitely. 
   - Examples of papers to keep include contracts, insurance policies, and certain tax documents.
   - Don't let papers pile up. Deal with mail and similar items as soon as they arrive.
   - Store all papers in one place and divide them into categories if necessary.

4. **Komono (Miscellaneous)**: 
   - This category includes everything else in your home that doesn't fit into the other categories. It can be broken down into smaller categories like CDs, skincare products, kitchen goods, etc.
   - The process is the same—gather all items of the same type, decide what sparks joy, and then organize the items you've chosen to keep.

5. **Sentimental items**: 
   - These are the items that have the most emotional value to you, like photos, letters, and keepsakes.
   - Kondo suggests dealing with these items last because by the time you get to this category, your decision-making skills will have improved.
   - Consider the true purpose of each item and ask yourself if it's fulfilling that purpose. For example, a beautiful photograph might be hidden away in a box when its purpose is to be seen.

Remember, the idea is not to get rid of things for the sake of it. The aim is to figure out your sense of value - what is genuinely important to you. If it makes you happy or serves a purpose in your life, it's worth keeping. Otherwise, it's probably just clutter.
