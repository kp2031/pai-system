Mexico _Kid __friendly resort_ options

(recos from Gowtham)

1. Hard Rock Maya Rivera - we went there when my son was 1 (he loves the water), he had a blast! There is a water park for the kids, the food was good (for a resort), rooms were great and like stroller accessible for majority of the resort! Probably one of my fav resorts that I've been to!

2. Iberostar Rose Hall Montego Bay- we were suppose to go in April of 2020 before my son turned 2 so he doesn't count as a ticket - we had to cancel due to the pandemic! This is also really good for the kids as well. Also they have a mini water park as well

3. Finest Punta Cana Excellence (Brand new resort). Really good reviews!

4. Grand Palladium Costa Mujeres Resort and Spa â€” Mexico Really good reviews for family and children.
