**_Pre –wedding Ceremonies (Vidhi)_**

The Vidhi occurs generally the day before the wedding and has various prayers which has different meanings.
The 3 different ceremonies on the day are below:

1. Mandva Mahurat & Griha Shant

This ceremony bears a deep religious significance because the parents of the couple seek the blessings of Mother Earth and ask permission to commence with the digging of the soil to erect the mandva or mandap (platform erected for the wedding rites covered with a canopy). Griha Shanti, a ceremony conducted to seek the blessings of all the nine planets, immediately follows the mandva mahurat. This is carried out in the respective home of the bride and the groom

1. Pithi

The bride sits on a bajat or low stool, palms upturned. It is the prerogative of the kaaki (paternal uncle’s wife) to mix the pithi (a paste of sandalwood powder, herbs, rosewater and mogra / attar (a type of perfume). She then arranges the pithi on a decorated platter and has it blessed by the priest. The women of the household apply the pithi on the bride’s skin.

1. Mameru or Mosaalu

The bride receives gifts from her maternal uncle which consists of clothes, jewellery and other gifts items including the traditional paanetar (silk saree – usually white with red border) and choodo (ivory bangle). The mameruceremony takes place one day before the wedding.
