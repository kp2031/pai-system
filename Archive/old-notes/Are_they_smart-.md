Are they smart? 
Do they get things done? 
Do I want to be around this person all day?

When calling referencesâ€¦
Ask specifically about projects they've worked on 
Ask if they were in the top 5% of anyone ever worked with 
Are they entrepreneurial

Animal test - what animal are they

Zuckerberg test - do i want to spend time with them and would I want to report to them 

Dan Pink - autonomy, mastery, purpose
