Way of working 

Seating:
- start every morning at WEB (except for WAM Monday's) to enable face to face conversations vs emails

Progress management:
I have daily scrum meetings with my team on how I can help them go faster 

We review actions for the following week every Wednesday morning - and brainstorm any course corrections 

We spend structured social time with key stakeholders - logistics, grocery, product, mobile/kiosk, communications, central ops, finance 

To discuss:
Is the Simon Monday meetings an update you have to give? If so - we need to meet before - at WEB?

Weekly direct reports meetings Tuesday morning 10am

Monthly Full Team meeting in a store?
- corporate updates
- monthly progress updates
(First week of the month - to discuss overall financials / month end)

Quarterly full team meeting at Nurun?
- to review current direction - get feedback from whole team
- discuss ways of working 
- team building activities
- guest speakers?
(Next one - first week of May?)
