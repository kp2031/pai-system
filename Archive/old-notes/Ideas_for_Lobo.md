# Ideas for Lobo

Hi Ajay - if you guys are thinking of pivoting into the retail side of Cannabis - check out these proven business models that are tech+retail.

I’m least familiar with this one, but basically, it’s a database service that retailers use to keep their _product_ data up to date and clean. GS1 would store all the attributes of a product into their database and the retailer would plug in and every time a customer lands on a product page, they have all the detailed contents within the product. Retailers pay for this - product manufacturers are incentivized to provide detailed specification data about their products because retailers and wholesalers can use this data to buy more product. 

This is a scale play. You can use time or funding to type up the details of as many legal product as possible, so your database is the biggest. Or use VC $ to incentivize everyone to use your database because it’s the biggest and become the widest used by retailers - then all the wholesalers will subscribe to it because a retailer will only want to buy products with your easily usable detailed product specs.
