# Wheel of happiness

RELATIONSHIPS 

An 80-year Harvard study shows that quality of relationships is one of the most significant contributors to feelings of happiness. This life theme encompasses all of your human connections and interactions including family and friends, loose connections and acquaintances, as well as romantic relationships with a spouse or partner.

CAREER

The career theme is related to your professional development no matter if you are an artist, physician, or entrepreneur. Your education and what you’ve chosen as your field of work is included in the career theme. For some it’s just a job and for others it’s their life's purpose, but what you do for work (and how important you perceive it to be) is a major contributor to happiness.

HEALTH

Health and wellness is the foundation of happiness and includes your physical and mental well-being. Humans strive to survive and thrive, but you can’t do the latter without the former. Your commitment to self-care has a direct impact on your happiness so it’s of the utmost important to know where you stand with this particular theme.

FINANCES

Living in a capitalist society, most of us equate security with money. Since security is at the base of our hierarchy of needs (just above the basics of food, shelter, and clothing), how we perceive our financial state influences how happy we are.

INTERESTS

Your personal interests are the cultural and social activities you like to engage in or what you do for fun and recreation. These hobbies are important because you associate them with relaxation and pleasure. They are a welcome break from the responsibilities that often cause stress. Therefore, your level of commitment to personal interests factors into feelings of happiness.

GROWTH

This is a broad category that’s related to your overall feelings of progress. Many people have a purpose and equate growth with how well they are manifesting that purpose. Others equate growth with their spiritual or philosophical beliefs and their ability to deepen their knowledge and practice of the ideals they garner from these doctrines. However you define growth, whether or not you believe you are progressing influences your level of happiness.
