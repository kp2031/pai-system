Digital minimalism

3 principles 
1. Clutter is costly - cluttering time and attention with too many apps, devices and services - creates an overall negative cost that swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation 
2. Optimization is important - deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only the first step, to truly extract the full benefit - think about how theyâ€™ll use the technology 
3. Intentionality is satisfying - independent of specific decisions they make - one of the reasons it is meaningful to practitioners
