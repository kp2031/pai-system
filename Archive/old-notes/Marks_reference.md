Mark's reference

Mark is a very hard working and intelligent individual with a keen sense for practical application of theoretical knowledge. 

His perseverance and progress through increasingly higher ranks in the military demonstrate Mark's commitment to hard work, leadership capability and intellectual capacity.

I would recommend him for work opportunities or educational progression without doubting he will do incredibly well. 

Mark is also a keen listener and a life-long learner. His pursuit for a deeper and deeper understanding of electrical engineering is evident in his passion for the topics he studies.
