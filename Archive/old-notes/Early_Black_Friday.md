Early Black Friday
- good morning!
- My name is Kavi and I’m so proud to lead the online team for Hardlines & Electronics 

- So Holiday gift giving is off to a good start Online with video games, TVs, home appliances leading the way

- The team has been working hard with vendors for the past 6 months for the right assortment and the lowest prices 

- We’re excited to see the full assortment selling in early deals - here are some of the top sellers across the departments 

- In the first hour alone we grew the business by 300% 

- We’re happy to see our products and prices really resonating with customers

- We’re off to a good start and I’m looking forward to what’s to come this week for our big Black Friday event
