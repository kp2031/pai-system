Daily trading volume
Market Cap = 10,000,000 to 500,000,000

The day trading academy's formula:
The Yellow Line is a Moving Linear Regression set at 89ish.
The band is a Keltner channel with the middle line set to EMA 55ish. with prob around a 3.5 multiplier to the upper & lower band.
Take trades with momentum off the middle EMA, with a tight stop, that's it!

**Momentum trading techniques**

**

* **		Daily "stock watch list" - **Momentum traders will typically have a daily "stock watch list" and stay in tune with daily news via television, message boards and websites.
* **		Volume as an indicator - **The momentum trader uses volume as a primary indicator. When a stock becomes popular for whatever reason, and there are more buyers than sellers, the stock price tends to rise, also increasing trading activity.
* **		Testing resistance levels - **After that, momentum traders look for a stock that is testing its resistance levels. If a stock is just making a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing, a momentum trader will look elsewhere. Once a stock breaks a resistance level - either up or down - it comes into play for a momentum opportunity.
* **		Technical indicators - **Momentum trading seeks out technical indicators of a resistance break. Many stock trading software programs show these trend lines for you automatically. Momentum traders do not attempt to buy at bottoms and sell at the top - rather, they jump on a price trend after a stock has clearly breached a resistance point and then either sell or short the stock when they have locked in sufficient profits. The greater the volume of trades in a stock, the less probability that the price momentum will reverse and a loss will occur.
* **		Cutting losses short and letting profits run - **The chief challenge in momentum trading comes down to knowing when to cut losses. Traders really seek to eke out small profits in percentage terms on a daily basis. If a trade starts to reverse, the short time horizon of the strategy makes it so that it's more sensible to exit a position once it starts going negative in order to limit losses over the long term. Luckily, resistance breaks with high volume; so long as momentum traders gets into the trade before the saturation point, they are generally relatively safe trading plays in most markets. When there is a change in price movement, the trader needs to have a pre-established strategy that leads to a quick exit from the stock position. However, once the trend establishes in the other direction the trader can trade the stock again. Trading momentum stocks works in both directions. Traders don’t make money-picking pairs, but rather by cutting losses short and letting profits run. And more importantly, they meet investment objectives through the judicious use of position sizing.
* **		Conservatism is the key - **Getting in and out of the trade before the saturation point arrives is a significant challenge. The saturation point is the point at which buy or sell orders start significantly to outnumber those on the opposite side of the trade. Naturally, this point can be difficult to predict, and it's somewhere between luck and art for a trader to consistently avoid being caught in a saturated price movement. Conservatism helps momentum traders to avoid this more often. It helps to have a ballpark estimate of acceptable gains and allowable losses target for every trade to prevent emotional reasoning from interfering with trading efficiency.
* **		Trading times - **Momentum traders will limit the times they trade to the first and last hour of the day trading session. This is due to the increased volatility that takes place during these two time slots. The most dangerous time zone for momentum traders is during lunch (12 - 2pm), when volume dries up and the moves are choppy to flat. Many seasoned momentum traders have learned to respect this time zone as a result of a trading blunder.
* **		Closing out trades - **All positions, even the bad ones, must be closed by the end of the day. Failing to close positions at the end of the day and allowing them to "ride" overnight can make them susceptible to many external and uncontrollable factors, including very different trading patterns the next day.
* **		Discipline - **Momentum trading is a strategy that requires an extraordinary amount of discipline. Successful traders can really only afford to pay attention to one or two stocks at once, as they need to be able to react to changes in the market with lightening rapidity. Many traders need to use margin in order to make significant profits, which magnifies the risks and increases the importance of stop-loss orders and other protective trading methods. Momentum trading falls somewhere between technical analysis trading and trend following as it relies on skills developed by both strategies.

average directional index (ADX) is an indicator used in technical analysis as an objective value for the strength of trend. ADX is non-directional so it will quantify a trend's strength regardless of whether it is up or down. ADX is usually plotted in a chart window along with two lines known as the DMI (Directional Movement Indicators). ADX is derived from the relationship of the DMI lines

**Determining the momentum of the market**

One method that momentum traders will use to tell if the market is offering nice pullbacks or when it will trade off of momentum is by checking the Average Directional Index (ADX) indicator.

* 		Readings below 25 indicate that the market will offer nice pullbacks to initiate swing trades.
* 		Readings above 25 indicate a strong trend - pullbacks will be shallow or nonexistent.

As long as the ADX indicator is above 25 and sloping up, the market will continue to trade off of momentum. Momentum is lost when it begins to slope down.
There is no such thing as a perfect technical indicator, but the ADX does a good job of telling the momentum trader the current strength of the trend being encountered.
**Trading momentum stocks**

Trading momentum stocks works for the basic reason that well-performing stocks tend to continue to outperform the rest of the stock market. Theorists argue as to whether this phenomenon is due to irrational investor behavior or whether these stocks are of better-managed companies. For the trader or investor trading momentum stocks, the theory does not matter. What matters is having an efficient system of stock market analysis for recognizing and trading stocks that seem to have momentum.
Trading momentum stocks involves generating software trade signals by following current market calculations, moving averages and channel breakouts to understand market direction. Because traders do not care what the underlying reason is for the stock price movement, they need to have a predetermined set of rules for exiting a trade if the market reverses.

**High probability with low risk**

When momentum trading is executed properly with a tried and tested trading plan and proper risk control, it displays a trading method that is often referred to as **High probability trading**.  Momentum trading can be very profitable when risk is handled properly. Stop loss orders should be highly considered to manage risk as part of a successful momentum trading plan.

**Pitfalls of momentum trading**

There are several situations that a momentum trader needs to aware of:
* 		jumping into a position too soon, before a momentum move is confirmed
* 		closing the position too late, after saturation has been reached
* 		failing to keep eyes on the screen, missing changing trends, reversals or signs of news that take the market by surprise
* 		keeping a position open overnight. Stocks are particularly susceptible to external factors occurring after the close of that day's trading - these factors could cause radically different prices and patterns the next day
* 		failing to act quickly to close a bad position, thereby riding the momentum train the wrong way down the tracks

Rule:
Don't bet against contract winners
