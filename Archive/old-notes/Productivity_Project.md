High impact tasks - 90% of the value you contribute to your company is contained in 3 tasks:
1. List everything you’re responsible for at work
2. If you could just do one item on the list - what item would allow you to accomplish the most with the same amount of time - what item on the list is the most important to your boss
3. If you could do only 2 more items let you accomplish the most in the same amount of time 

The rule of 3
1. At the beginning of every day, fast forward to the end of the day and determine what three things would you want to have accomplished by the end of the day
2. Do the same at the beginning of the week 
3. Identify when, where and how you’re going to complete these tasks 

Learn to:
- Deflect unimportant work
