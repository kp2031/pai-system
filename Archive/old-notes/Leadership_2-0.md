Leadership 2.0
- John C. Maxwell

When opportunity comes, it’s too late to prepare- John Wooten, legendary UCLA coach 

Leadership is Influence 

Insights on influence

5 levels of leadership:
1. Position - because they have to 
2. Permission - good relationships - want to - starts with heart, not head 
3. Production - results - what you’ve done 
4. People development - what you’ve done for them 
5. Respect - who you are and what you represent
