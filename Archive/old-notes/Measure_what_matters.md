# Measure what matters

OKRs
- A management methodology that helps ensures the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the company

And objective
- what is to be achieved
- Significant, concrete, action oriented,inspirational

1.
Engage and educate through a browsing experience to help costumers get inspired to save money 

2.
Develop a best in class Omni shopping search to help customers find exactly what they want

3.
Earn the trust and loyalty of more of our customers by providing our flagship mobile experience on the App

 Key results (KRs)
- Benchmark and Monitor how to get to the objective
- Specific and time bound
- Aggressive and realistic
-  measurable and verifiable
- You either meet at the results requirement or you don’t
- Not a KR unless it has a number
- At the end of the designated period e.g. quarter for KR is fulfilled or not

The floor OKR super powers
1. focused and commit to priorities
2. Align and connect for teamwork
3. Track for accountability
4. Stretch for amazing

CFR – conversation feedback recognition

AMB - as measured by

We will achieve this objective _as measured by_ the following results

OKRs are works in progress
KRs should be 
- succinct 
- Specific
- Measurable 
- Mix of outputs and inputs 
- Completion of all key results must result in attainment of the objective (if not, it’s not an OKR)

Committed (Business) Objective
- 100% completion
- Food and shelter 

 aspirational  (stretch) objectives
- 60%-70% completion 
- Self actualization  

Conversation one - related to compensation - backward looking - held at year end

Conversation two - 
1. What are you working on?
2. How are your OKRs coming along?
3. Is there anything impeding your work?
4. What do you need from me to be more successful?
5. How do you need to grow to achieve your career goals?

OKRs contribute to less than a third of compensation calculation - it’s more important to get feedback from cross functional team

Five critical areas of conversation during a one on one
1. Goal setting and reflection - The employees OKR plan is set for the coming cycle - how best to align individual objectives and he results with the organizational priorities
2. Ongoing progress updates - brief data-driven check-ins on the employees real-time progress, with problem-solving as needed - what’s working well? What’s not working well?
3. Two way coaching – to help contributors reach their potential and managers do a better job
4. Career growth – to develop skills, identify growth opportunities, expand employees vision of their future at the company
5. Lightweight performance reviews – A feedback mechanism to gather inputs and summarize what the employee has accomplished since the last meeting,  in the context of the organization’s need

Sharing recognition 
1. Institute peer to peer recognition 
2. Establish clear criteria - recognize people for actions and results, completion of special projects, achievement of company goals, demonstrations of the company’s values
3. Share recognition stories
4. Make recognition frequent and attainable
5. Tie recognition to company goals and strategies

Culture
- Common language - we are all talking about the same thing and what we are talking about has meaning
- A common framework for decision making
- Make key functions replicable and scalable
- Aspiration and values: who do we want to be as of an organization? How do we want people to feel about their work and our product? what’s the impact we want to make in the world?

Intel’s values from 1985
1. People oriented - we value a strong mutual commitment, respect for all work, challenge and opportunity
2. Openness - highlighting of problems or issues expected
3. Issue resolution - clean and Crisp, confrontation must be constructive
4. Results – output orientation in all work, superficiality not respected, reward successes with positive feedback
5. Discipline -  excellence in a highly competitive, complex environment demands it
6. Risk-taking – high technology orientation necessitates it
7. Low fear of failing/self exposure - champions 
8. Trust and integrity

Five questions to ask each team member to determine their quality of engagement
1. Structure and clarity – are goals, roles and execution plans on our team clear?
2. Psychological safety – can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
3. What’s the meaning of our work - are we working on something that’s personally important for each of us?
4. Dependability – can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time?
5. Do we fundamentally believe that the work we are doing matters - what is the impact of our work?

Committed versus aspirational OKRs

- Commitments – are OKRs that we agree will be achieved and we will be willing to adjust schedules and resources to ensure they are delivered - The expected score of a committed OKR is 1.0 - A score of less than one requires explanations for the miss as it shows errors in planning or execution

LVO - low value objectives - nobody will notice that you achieved this objective -  redefine the objective to be tangible and noticeable by the company or end-users and use the LVO as the sub-objective / KR

Team play 
Communication 
Ambition in goal setting
