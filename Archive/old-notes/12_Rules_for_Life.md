12 Rules for Life

A summary of disciplinary rules

1. Limit the rules 
2. Use minimum necessary force
3. Parents come in pairs 
4. Parents should understand their own capacity to be: harsh, vengeful, arrogant, resentful, angry deceitful — e.g. a misbehaving child will breed resentment and then vengeance, if not addressed
5. Parents have a duty to act as a proxy for the real world - merciful and caring proxy 

It is the primary duty of the parents to make their child socially desirable, that will provide the child with opportunity, self regard and security 

**_Life lie_**

I naïvely formulated goal transmutes with time into the sinister form of the life lie

That’s not a plan, that’s a travel poster 
1 week later you’re hung over, 3 weeks later you’re bored stiff, 1 year later you’re pathetic 

Single axiom Ideologies
- government is bad or immigration is bad, capitalism is bad, patriarchy is bad

Belief, narcissistically, under bad theory that the world could be put right if only they held the controls

Another problem, based on avoidance: 
- sin of commission: you do something you know to be wrong 

- sin of omission: you let something bad happen when you could do something to stop it 

Someone who insists that everything is right in their life
- avoids conflict, miles, does what is told
-
