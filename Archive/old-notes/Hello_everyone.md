Hello everyone

My name is Kavi, I am Vishal’s cousin. 

I was very fortunate to grow up with Vishal.

One of my fondest memories with Vishal growing up was going to Garba ... not to do Garba, but to play ball hockey in the hallways. 

You could always count on Vishal for having a tennis ball - and being ready to play anytime

Another fond memory I have with Vishal is that we would wake up at all hours of the night to watch a cricket match 

With 20 friends and family members packed around one small TV to watch India play

Little did Vishal know that waking up at all hours of the night would be preparation for him for residency 

All of the cousins, whether in Toronto, Houston or around the world 

can say without a doubt that Vishal is one of the nicest and most loving - not just cousin, but most loving people they know. 

He is such a great son to his parents, 

a caring nephew to his uncles and aunts 

and will now be a very loving husband to Nisha

Nisha you have won the heart of one of our best

You are both very lucky 

From my few dinners we’ve had all together, 

I can already see that the 

quiet and loving nature of Vishal, combined with the 

bold and fun nature of Nisha will definitely make a power couple that only Jay Z and Beyoncé can compete with

On behalf of all the cousins, we love you very much - and will always be here to support the two of you

Thank you very much - And now over to Saysath
