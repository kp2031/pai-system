Designing your life

5 mindsets - help get unstuck and take progressive next steps
1. Curiosity mindset - Be curious - there’s something interesting about everything - what do experts in this field argue about?
2. Biased to action mindset - Try stuff - what can I do to help answer that question? What’s actionable and what will we learn?
3. Reframing mindset - reframe problems - what perspective do I have and others have? Describe the problem from their perspective? this is easy to fix; how will this look in a year? We can skip this.
4. Awareness mindset - know it’s a process - what are all the steps in front of you and behind you? Are you on the right step? What would happen if you don’t think more than one step ahead? What’s the worst thing that can happen and how likely is it to happen, how likely, and what would you do? What’s the best thing that can happen?
5. Radical collaboration mindset - ask for help - ask for help journal, mentor, ask for 5 min of feedback 

Compass & Practices 

- compass: great big organizing ideas of your work view and life view; along with your values; help you answer to: how’s it going? Inform how in-sync you are between: who you are? What you believe? What you’re doing? (Coherence between these three questions)

- 

———————————

Step one
Come up with three versions of yourself

Barring money and judgment what would that one version be?

Step two
Pick one and Prototype

Step three
Execute 

How’s it going? (Areas to design for)
1. Health - mind, body, spirit 
2. Work - paid or unpaid 
3. Play - what gives you joy
4. Love - affection, community - sense of connection 

Awareness & curiosity - design mindsets

Work view (250 words ~30 min)
- what good work deserves to be
- Why work?
- What’s work for?
- What does work mean?
- How does it relate to the individual, others, society?
- What defines good or worthwhile work?
- What does money have to do with it?
- What you experience, growth and fulfillment have to do with it?

Don’t write down what you want in a job description, this exercise is to develop your philosophy of work, why, what it’s for, what it means. Your work manifesto.

Good time journal:
(Two elements)
1. Activity log
2. record where I am engaged and energized
3. Simply lists your primary activities and how energized you were doing them
4. Complete 2 to 3 times a week at minimum, daily if possible
5. Reflections
6. where I discover what I’ve learned
7. All of us are motivated by different kinds of work activity, this exercise will help you learn and understand what motivates you with as much specificity as possible

Anchor problems
- they hold us in one place and prevent motion
- They keep us stuck
- Different from a gravity problem which can never be solved, not impossible
- Don’t anchor yourself on the one perfect solution that can’t work or is too hard
- Psychological element to anchor problem is that you have a perfect solution and you’re stuck but you also have a fear that no matter what you try it won’t work so sometimes it’s easier to be stocked then screwed

Come up with 3 alternative of the next five years of your life
1. Visual graphical timeline
2. Six word headline to describe the life alternative
3. Questions this life is going to answer and you will learn about yourself
4. A dashboard to gauge resources skills capabilities contact, likability do you love this plan or not like it so much, confidence, coherence  
5.
