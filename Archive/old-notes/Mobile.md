4 keys to mobile - MIST

M - mobile - feel naive, save time, easy store finder, favorite items, fast list of items for popular items; Amazon: purchasing, research; people are mobile, not devices 

I - intimate - indexes, surveys, databases, profiles - to help personalize experience; 

S - social - two or more people interacting - facilitate the processes of: forward, earmark, re-post, like, share and maybe alter the content - with friends and their social network; keep it simple 

T - transactional - make it as easy as possible to go from “I want that” to converting on that intent 

Three filters to help prioritize: Portable, Personal, Potent
- Portable: does my customer need to be carrying this around - different functions depending on where they are 

- Personal- make your product their own - not only about product recommendations, make customers feel they’ve built it
- Potent - how good it is - and why someone would share it with friends
