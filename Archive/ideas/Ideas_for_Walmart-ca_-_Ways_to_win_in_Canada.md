# Ideas for Walmart.ca / Ways to win in Canada

**_Invest in the platform_**

 
Invest to accelerate AI tech to predict and recommend the store to pickup (or have your order picked) for your order to be fulfilled close to 100% full/complete as possible (to accommodate for the reality of imperfect store inventory)
 
Invest to accelerate “Speed” transparency communications to customers - 
1. Delivery — when a picker starts to pick their order we text / show customers in the app … like dominos pizza tracker / Uber eats… when it’s boxed and labeled waiting to be picked up… when it’s been picked up and on its way… when it’s been delivered with a photo on your doorstep. 
2. Pickup— when the order drops to the store, when the pickers start their order, done picking the order, staged and waiting for you to check-in and be on your way + when you arrive, when the order is being brought out to your car, thank you and rating of your pickup experience right in the app 

 
Invest to accelerate in making the site / app load faster - more servers?
 
Build/buy/partner (with Homestars?) to promote local service businesses in Search e.g. you’re looking for STEM toys and there’s an ad for local math lessons/tutoring // buying a can of paint, local painters that use the paint you buy at Walmart - we don’t sell the service, we just promote it / make the connection…. You buy a large swing set and there’s services they build it for you - tech partnership with “handyman” / home services startups 
 
Build (or buy or partner with Shopify?) to develop tech for individuals/new entrepreneurs to websites with Walmart add to cart buttons - the reverse idea of our relationship with Shopify - e.g. you build a Shopify website curating your favorite Walmart items and have Walmart add to cart buttons and it adds to your Walmart order (and you get a small cut as an “affiliate” type of program
 
Accelerate investment in personalization technology / AI and on-site/app customer inputs (asking customers if the recos we shared were “thumbs up / thumbs down” so we learn more about individuals algorithmically and recommend better products based on their implicit and explicit preferences by sub-category
 
Invest to accelerate making the site feel more local (opposite of generic Amazon site) - photo of the store manager greeting the visitors, photo of the store as the header/background taken by a local instagram photographer
 
Develop tech/capability for Gifting starting with gift receipts (++ future wrapping, personalized or generic note, greeting card)
 
(Marketing) Build/buy tech to automatically make a YouTube/Instagram/TikTok video of the top 10 best selling items / best deals at Walmart this week informing customers to not miss out
 
 
**_Invest in the proposition_**

 
Invest in turning on all low priced items including items they compete with Dollarama - WM Dollar Shop
 
“No minimum, Free pickup” proposition (force this to be true by removing items that don’t offer free pickup from eligibility?)
 
Invest in lowering to $25 threshold for Free delivery unscheduled (to compete against Prime customers ~80% of Canadian non-poverty households have Prime (TBC), so we’re competing against it because it’s so ubiquitous)
 
Free Grocery home delivery over $100 (to compete against _Amazon Grocery_ and PC Express)
 
Invest in a graduated subscribe and save program for everyday consumable goods with a discount starting from the second order (e.g. 2% for 1 item subscription, 3% off 2 item subscription, 3%...4%...maxes out at 5% off order)
 
When free pickup is nil picked, express delivered to your home for free
 
Automation for: Revealing searches with no perfect matches or with no clicks…  to Merchants and strategic 3rd party sellers so they work on sourcing and listing items customer are looking for that we don’t carry 
 
Online bulk barn - sell bulk goods by weight 
 
Invest in a local Canadian call center that can help older / less tech savvy customers place extended aisle or MP (or even OG?) orders 
 
Call center could make quick thank you calls for big orders or after 5th OG purchase to appreciate the customer for shopping at Walmart and ask for their feedback to make the service better
 
Run a low cost delivery run once a week to aboriginal reservations with our own trucks as a free-grocery-pickup-from-truck, similar to our campus program
 
 
 
**_Invest in infrastructure _**

 
Buy someone like Mr. Case to create WM Delivery - save people money that run small businesses
 
Leverage low cost of capital to invest in Capex that can be cost-per-order-leveraged through increased volumes e.g. Buy more trucks to lower cost of last mile / you want to be paying for delivery time/drivers and not volumetric/per parcel - especially because we sell a lot of low margin, bulky consumables (paper towels, toilet paper)
 
Leverage low cost of capital to build dedicated eCom DCs for Vendors - in a Pay for Scan model (we own the building and run it, you own the inventory, but we take possession of the inventory when someone buys it, so it’s our Sales, similar to 2P DSV)
 
Make a next day free home delivery commitment on 1000 everyday essential needs items (non-food private brand to start?) that are unbeatable in price 
 
Number all parking spots so it reduces the stress of customers trying to fight for an pickup spot - assumes in the future all customers are Omni / mixed shoppers, all the time, and they want to pickup their extended aisle/MP items and also go in the store for other items
