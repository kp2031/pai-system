### Brea### s### t ### Milk###  ### Quick Facts### 

* If baby drinks from a bottle and milk remains, it’s safe to give the bottle back to baby but _only for an hour._ After the hour, toss the milk.

* Freshly expressed breast milk can be kept at _room temperature_ for up to 4 hours.
* Freshly expressed breast milk can be stored in the back of the _refrigerator_ for up to 4 days.
* You can add freshly expressed breast milk to refrigerated or frozen milk. However, thoroughly cool the freshly expressed breast milk in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice packs before adding it to previously chilled or frozen milk.

* Your breast milk changes to meet your baby's needs. Breast milk expressed when a baby is a newborn will not meet the same needs when he is a few months older.

* Store the expressed milk in a clean, capped food-grade glass container or special plastic bags designed for milk collection and storage. Don't store breast milk in disposable bottle liners or plastic bags designed for general household use.

* When storing breast milk, write the date, time of day and approximate amount on the bag. 

* When storing formula, store formula in the back of the refrigerator, where it is coldest. Label the bottle before placing in the fridge with date and approximate time when opened. 

* Discard any open formula bottles after 48 hrs hours in the fridge. 

* Once you've opened ready-to-use (premixed) liquid formula, store it in closed bottles or tightly cover the container and refrigerate immediately. After 48 hours, discard any that's left over, because bacteria may have formed.
