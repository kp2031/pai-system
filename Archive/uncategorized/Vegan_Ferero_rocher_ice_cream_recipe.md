Sure, here’s a plant-based Ferrero Rocher-inspired ice cream recipe. It incorporates the rich chocolate and hazelnut flavors iconic to the treat. Please note that homemade ice cream volumes can be a bit hard to predict precisely, but this recipe should give you approximately 15oz:

Ingredients:

	•	1 cup canned full-fat coconut milk
	•	1/4 cup hazelnuts, toasted and skinned
	•	2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
	•	1/4 cup vegan dark chocolate, melted
	•	3 tablespoons agave nectar or maple syrup
	•	A pinch of salt
	•	1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
	•	2 tablespoons crushed hazelnuts for mix-ins

Instructions:

	1.	In a blender, combine the coconut milk, 1/4 cup of hazelnuts, cocoa powder, melted chocolate, agave nectar or maple syrup, salt, and vanilla extract. Blend until the mixture is smooth.
	2.	Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
	3.	Just before the ice cream is finished churning, add the crushed hazelnuts to distribute them throughout the ice cream.
	4.	Once churned, transfer the ice cream to a lidded container. For a firmer consistency, freeze it for at least 2 hours before serving.

Enjoy this Ferrero Rocher-inspired treat! Remember to adjust the sweetness as desired, since flavors can become more muted once frozen.
