Prompt: What are some highly rated active noise canceling headphones for toddlers?

As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time product ratings or reviews, but I can suggest some popular noise-canceling headphones for toddlers that have received positive feedback from customers in the past:
1. Puro Sound Labs JuniorJams - These headphones are designed specifically for children and have a volume-limited sound output to protect children's hearing. They also offer active noise cancellation technology to reduce background noise.
2. LilGadgets Connect+ Pro Kids Headphones - These headphones are designed to be lightweight and comfortable for young children. They have a built-in volume limiter and offer passive noise isolation to reduce external noise.
3. Mokata Kids Headphones - These headphones are designed for children aged 3-16 and have a built-in volume limiter to prevent hearing damage. They also offer active noise cancellation technology to reduce background noise.

When choosing noise-canceling headphones for toddlers, it's important to consider safety features such as volume limiters and durability. It's also important to choose headphones that are comfortable and lightweight to avoid discomfort during extended use.
