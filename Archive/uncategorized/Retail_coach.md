All category weekly demand curves
Simulation modeling - how much you can make if you add a t-shirt in your range between your $25 shirts and your $75 shirts

Demand based google advertising - the right keyword at the right week - optimizes your advertising spend - simulation / AI to show you what you could make if you dialed up your google ads in some categories/keywords vs other categories/keywords - with the same dollars and with more dollars - 
if you have a constant stream of your cash going into growing your business e.g. 5% of last weeks profits get reinvested - like a dividend reinvestment plan - simulation of how much you can make with 20 years of “profits reinvestment”

Journaling 

Simulation to tell you what types of decisions/ recommendations you should follow that is you “plan” and if you follow one kind of retail strategy what the $ you could make are, at a cost - to also simulate diminishing returns

Simulate different types of advertising from Google ads to making YouTube videos - it’ll tell you how you should spend your time and if you do, how much you could make

Journaling time spent so it can simulate how much time you want to put into any given activity in any given week - simulates how you should spend your time by week - what you need to focus on that week to stick to your retail strategy 

Capacity analysis and recommendations on where to increase capacity
By optimizing time spent on each activity (because it knows how long each activity is supposed to take and remembers how long it took you last time) with an awareness of number of people working on it and a full workweek - so it recommends when you need to hire more people to do specific tasks that you’re not doing on time - and that not doing it on time costs you growth and money 

**_P_****_rocrastination _****_E_****_liminator_**

Journaling work-back - to allows the system to recommend what you should work on this week - that takes 3 weeks to finish, because it will become important in 3 weeks - and what doing it a week earlier would get you and doing a week later would cost - for your 1 year plan and 20 year plan
Build in standard retail workflows like placing orders for products, price analysis, product development and design, inventory analysis, marketing - simulate the connection of you working on specific types of activities _by week_ and their corresponding outcomes - so an uptick in sales happens when you do that type of activity in that specific week of the year 
It helps prepare for seasonal peaks and valleys and helps you understand diminishing return on your efforts related to different types of activities eg. Spending all your time on marketing and ignoring inventory management for too many weeks can have a financial impact - and it simulates that impact 

Basic plan - updates commodity prices, inflation, etc. quarterly
Pro subscription plan - updates weekly 

Don’t ignore me
Highlights what’s not being worked on, that should be, and needs some love - items that haven’t been updated, process that haven’t been executed e.g. email to customers about promotions 

**_Cost optimizer_**

Cost increase simulation that’s tied to commodity price simulation by category - and corresponding price of product price inflation required to keep up with your margins - simulated out 20 years - monthly commodity price updates with refreshed simulations 

Annual Journaling feature where you put in exactly how much things cost eg markers and how long they last before you replace it - industry simulation for how long basic things last with “regular” use... but if you track it and input actual data, constantly - it will trend into the future and show the connection between that and how much you’ll make over time 
And recommend lower cost alternatives - simulation 

Simulator to recommend country of origin for your products based on commodity prices in different countries eg making T-shirts in China vs India vs Bangladesh 

Star rating trending and simulation with recommendations on where you should focus based on customer feedback
Simulation and recommendations based on where you don’t have good customer feedback data and how you can dial up feedback for items marketing - “please provide a review”

Assortment planning tool with forward simulation about adding items in specific categories at specific price points and what that can do to your annual profit and what that translates to over 20 years
 

Showing shipping simulation - to save you money by using different size boxes / envelopes - so you redesign your products for a cheaper end to end operation 

Simulation that shows the price elasticity of your different categories - as customers buy different lines within a single category - it shows you your brand’s ability to sell a certain price point in a specific category 

Journaling your decisions
(Categorized - eg trend, paste competitor screenshot, why you decided to make that decision)
