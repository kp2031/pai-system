# Benefits of a digital experience analysis tool

- Revenue based analysis that’s easy to do - how much did the HP banners make? Which can improve resource allocation based on financials 

- 

- Impression based stats - e.g. banner at bottom of page had a viewed-and-clicked rate than one in the middle of the page 
	- Everything doesn’t have to be tagged to understand what customers are engaging in

	- 

- improved accuracy of data-driven business cases - less guessing why customers are behaving the way they are

- 

- AI notifications when experiences aren’t performing to expectations

- 

- More easily understandable and usable than Adobe for store merchants e.g. natural language queries

ContentSquare works with over 600 enterprise clients including BestBuy, Home Depot, the Gap and Disney - and fully up and running through US Black Friday
