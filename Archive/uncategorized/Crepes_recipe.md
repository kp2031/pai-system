To make half the amount of the original recipe using a Vitamix blending cup, you would halve each of the ingredients. Here's the modified recipe:

Ingredients:

- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon melted butter

Instructions:

1. Add the milk, water, egg, and melted butter into the Vitamix blending cup.

2. Then add the flour and salt on top. This helps prevent the dry ingredients from sticking to the bottom.

3. Screw on the cup's blade base tightly, then invert it onto the blender base.

4. Blend on a medium to high setting until the mixture is fully blended and smooth, which should take about 10-20 seconds.

5. Let the batter rest for an hour if possible, as it allows the flour to fully absorb the liquid, leading to a smoother texture and better-tasting crepes.

6. When you're ready to cook, heat a lightly oiled pan over medium-high heat.

7. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the batter into the pan for each crepe, tilting the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.

8. Cook each crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen it with a spatula, flip and cook the other side.

Remember to adjust the heat as necessary while cooking, as every stove is different. Enjoy your crepes!
