- Start by leveraging why people love Walmart today - save money, one stop shop

- Why do customers not change stores - they know where everything is 
- If we now have contact free curbside pickup - it becomes like going to any McDonald’s - you know the menu - so you can go to any one and get a predictable experience
- Your app knows where you are - so it can tell you what store will be the fastest for you to drop by and pickup your order 
- kept logged in for months
- Uses mobile behaviors - text message, direct messaging, double tapping to like
- UI first over Features
- building key features that aren’t easily transferable - e.g. Spotify playlists, shared Spotify playlists across friends (got all friends to use Spotify)
- % of features being used
