Whatâ€™s the difference between O and KR in OKRs?

In the context of the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) goal-setting framework, "O" stands for Objective, and "KR" stands for Key Results.
An Objective is a clear and specific goal that an organization or team is working towards. It should be ambitious, but achievable, and should align with the broader goals of the organization. The objective should be stated in a way that is clear and easy to understand.
Key Results are the specific, measurable outcomes that need to be achieved in order to reach the objective. There should be a clear link between the objective and the key results, and the key results should be specific and measurable. Key results should be quantifiable, so that progress can be tracked and success can be measured.
Together, the objective and key results form the OKR framework, which helps organizations and teams set and achieve clear and measurable goals. The OKR framework is used to align individual and team goals with the broader goals of the organization, and to track progress and measure success.

Can you elaborate on each point?

Certainly! Here is more information on each component of the OKR framework:
Objective: An Objective is a clear and specific goal that an organization or team is working towards. It should be ambitious, but achievable, and should align with the broader goals of the organization. The objective should be stated in a way that is clear and easy to understand. For example, an objective for a web design team might be "Increase website traffic by 25% over the next quarter." This objective is specific, measurable, and achievable, and it aligns with the overall goal of increasing the reach and visibility of the website.
Key Results: Key Results are the specific, measurable outcomes that need to be achieved in order to reach the objective. There should be a clear link between the objective and the key results, and the key results should be specific and measurable. Key results should be quantifiable, so that progress can be tracked and success can be measured. For example, a key result for the objective of "Increase website traffic by 25% over the next quarter" might be "Increase website traffic from 100,000 visitors per month to 125,000 visitors per month." This key result is specific, measurable, and quantifiable, and it helps track progress towards the objective.
Together, the objective and key results form the OKR framework, which helps organizations and teams set and achieve clear and measurable goals. The OKR framework is used to align individual and team goals with the broader goals of the organization, and to track progress and measure success. By setting and achieving OKRs, organizations can drive growth and innovation, and create a culture of continuous improvement.
