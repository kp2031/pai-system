Upward economic mobility

What are the best tactics countries have used to improve upward economic mobility?

There are several tactics that countries have used to improve upward economic mobility, including:
1. Investing in education: Providing access to quality education and training programs can help individuals acquire the skills they need to secure higher-paying jobs.
2. Promoting job creation: Policies that encourage job growth and entrepreneurship can help create more opportunities for individuals to climb the economic ladder.
3. Implementing progressive taxation: Progressive taxation systems, where higher earners are taxed at a higher rate, can help redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality.
4. Providing a safety net: Programs like unemployment insurance, welfare, and healthcare can help individuals and families weather economic downturns and provide a cushion for those who fall on hard times.
5. Implementing labor market policies: Policies such as minimum wage increases, collective bargaining rights, and paid leave can help to ensure that workers are paid fairly and have the stability and security needed to support themselves and their families.

It's worth noting that these are just some examples and the effectiveness of these policies may vary depending on the country's specific context and political structure.

Which have the most scientific evidence?

There is a significant amount of research and evidence supporting the effectiveness of several tactics for improving upward economic mobility, including:
1. Investing in education: Studies have consistently shown that investing in education can have a positive impact on economic mobility. Education has been found to be positively associated with higher earnings, lower poverty rates, and greater economic stability.
2. Providing a safety net: Programs such as unemployment insurance, welfare, and healthcare have been shown to be effective in reducing poverty and providing a cushion for those who fall on hard times.
3. Implementing labor market policies: Policies such as minimum wage increases, collective bargaining rights, and paid leave have been found to be effective in increasing the wages and benefits of low-paid workers, reducing income inequality and poverty.
4. Progressive taxation: Studies have found that countries with more progressive tax systems tend to have less income inequality and greater economic mobility.

It's worth noting that the evidence for the effectiveness of policies promoting job creation, or Entrepreneurship is mixed and depend on the country's specific context and political structure.
It's also worth noting that no policy is universally effective and each country's specific context and political structure should be taken into account when evaluating the effectiveness of different tactics for improving upward economic mobility.

What countries have the highest upward economic mobility?

Countries with high upward economic mobility tend to have strong social safety nets, good education systems, and low levels of income inequality. Some examples of countries that have been identified as having high upward economic mobility include:
1. Denmark: The country has a strong welfare system, high levels of education, and low income inequality, all of which contribute to high levels of economic mobility.
2. Norway: The country has a strong welfare system, high levels of education and low income inequality.
3. Finland: The country has a strong welfare system and high levels of education, which contribute to high levels of economic mobility.
4. Canada: The country has a relatively low poverty rate and a strong social safety net, which help to promote upward economic mobility.
5. Germany: The country has a strong apprenticeship system, which allows many young people to enter well-paying skilled trades, and low income inequality, which helps to promote upward economic mobility.
6. Sweden: The country has a strong welfare system and high levels of education, which contribute to high levels of economic mobility.

It's worth noting that the data regarding economic mobility is complex and different rankings and measurements may show different results. It's also worth noting that economic mobility is not only affected by the policies of one country but also by the global economy and political context.

What are the measures or rankings for upward economic mobility?

There are several measures and rankings that can be used to evaluate upward economic mobility. Some of the most commonly used include:
1. Intergenerational income elasticity (IGE): This measure compares the income of children to their parents and is used to determine how likely it is for children to earn more or less than their parents. A lower IGE indicates higher upward mobility.
2. Gini coefficient: This measure is used to determine the level of income inequality in a country. A lower Gini coefficient indicates less income inequality, which is associated with higher upward mobility.
3. Poverty rate: This measure is used to determine the percentage of people living in poverty in a country. A lower poverty rate is associated with higher upward mobility.
4. Social Mobility Index (SMI): The SMI is a composite index that combines different measures to rank countries based on their ability to provide equal opportunities for economic mobility.
5. The World Bank Economic Mobility Index: This index measures the degree of economic mobility across countries, based on the intergenerational income mobility and the income inequality.

These are just some examples, and there are many other ways to measure economic mobility. It's worth noting that economic mobility is a complex phenomenon and different measures may provide different insights and rankings. Also, it's important to keep in mind that these measures or rankings are based on data that may not be up-to-date, and the political and economic context of the country can change rapidly.

What are the top countries with the lowest IGE?

Intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) is a measure that compares the income of children to their parents and is used to determine how likely it is for children to earn more or less than their parents. Countries with a lower IGE have higher upward mobility, meaning that children have a higher chance of earning more than their parents. Some of the top countries with the lowest IGE include:
1. Denmark: Denmark has one of the lowest IGEs in the world, indicating high upward mobility.
2. Norway: Norway has a relatively low IGE, indicating high upward mobility.
3. Finland: Finland has a relatively low IGE, indicating high upward mobility.
4. Canada: Canada also has a relatively low IGE, indicating high upward mobility.
5. Germany: Germany has a relatively low IGE, indicating high upward mobility.
6. Sweden: Sweden has a relatively low IGE, indicating high upward mobility.

It's worth noting that the data regarding economic mobility is complex and different rankings and measurements may show different results. It's also worth noting that economic mobility is not only affected by the policies of one country but also by the global economy and political context.

What are the top countries related to the SMI?

The Social Mobility Index (SMI) is a composite index that combines different measures to rank countries based on their ability to provide equal opportunities for economic mobility. Different institutions or organizations may have different ranking based on different data and measurements. However, based on recent data:
1. Denmark: Denmark is often considered to have the highest level of social mobility in the world, and has consistently ranked near the top of the SMI.
2. Norway: Norway is also considered to have a high level of social mobility and has ranked well on the SMI.
3. Finland: Finland has also ranked well on the SMI and is considered to have a high level of social mobility.
4. Canada: Canada has also been consistently ranked high on the SMI and is considered to have a high level of social mobility.
5. Germany: Germany has also been consistently ranked high on the SMI and is considered to have a high level of social mobility.
6. Sweden: Sweden has also been consistently ranked high on the SMI and is considered to have a high level of social mobility.

It's worth noting that these ranking may change over time, and different institutions may have different results based on their methodology. It's also important to keep in mind that these measures or rankings are based on data that may not be up-to-date, and the political and economic context of the country can change rapidly.

What are some of the most cited scientific studies for economic mobility?

There are many scientific studies that have been conducted on economic mobility, and the most cited studies may vary depending on the specific research question and data used. However, some of the most well-known and frequently cited studies on economic mobility include:
