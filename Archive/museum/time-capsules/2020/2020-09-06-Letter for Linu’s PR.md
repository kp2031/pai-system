# Letter for Linu’s PR

To whom it may concern,

I’m writing this letter as a support document for Linu’s Canadian permanent residence application.

My wife Priyanka and I have known Linu since 2011, when my sister Meera and Linu started dating one another. We had the opportunity to spend time with multiple times and think they make a great pair. They make each other laugh and understand each other’s quirks. They have grown and have made each other better and more balanced. 

After multiple years of love they were married in 2015. Since they have been married, we have had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with them on family vacations and gatherings and they make a wonderful couple. Their relationship is filled with love, happiness, respect, communication and trust, all the things one needs for a successful relationship.

Linu has accepted our family as his and over the years has done an incredible job taking care of my parents and helping out wherever needed. We couldn’t have asked for a better person to become a part of our family. 

As a couple, Linu and my sister have had the opportunity to travel together around the world on many adventures from Thailand to Spain and across the United States and Canada. With the birth of my nephew last year, they have chosen to build roots in Toronto, near family so that he can be a part of all of our lives. We are so excited for them to be here and will be there to provide all the love and support they need.

Thank you,

Kavi Patel
