Subtle art if not giving a f*ck

Good values
- Honesty 
- Innovation 
- Vulnerability 
- Standing up for ones self & others
- Self respect
- Curiosity 
- Humility
- Creativity 

Bad values
- Dominance through manipulation or violence 
- Indiscriminate pleasure seeking
- Feeling good all the time
- Always being the centre of attention
- Not being alone 
- Being liked by everybody 
- Being rich for the sake of being rich
- Sacrificing small animals to pagan gods

Good values can be experienced alone, immediate and you can control & engage you with the world as it is vs the way you wish it were.

Bad values are reliant on external events. Flying in a private jet, being told you’re right all the time, owning a house in the Bahamas.

Values are about prioritization. 

What are the values that you prioritize above everything else? And that therefore influence your decision making more than anything else.

When we have poor values, or poor standards we have for ourselves and others - we’re essentially giving f*cks about the things that don’t matter - things that in fact make our life worse.

When we choose better values - we are able to divert our f*cks to something better, towards Things that matter, things that improve the state of our well being, and generate happiness as side-effects.

Prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a f*uck about - because when you give better f*cks, you get better problems, and when you get better problems, you get a better life.

5 counterintuitive values

1. Radical Responsibility — Taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who is at fault
2. Uncertainty — the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs 
3. Failure — the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so they may be improved upon 
4. Rejection — the ability to say and hear “No”, this clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life 
5. Contemplation of ones own mortality — only thing that helps keep all our other values in perspective 

Details 

1. We, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us, but we always control how we interpret what happens to us and how we respond. Choosing to not consciously interpret and respond to the events in our lives is still a response to the events in our lives. It is still your responsibility to interpret the meaning of the event and choose a response. We are always interpreting every moment, and choosing the values by which we live and the metrics by which we measure everything that happens to us. Events can be good or bad depending on the metric we choose to use.

Responsibility and fault are not the same thing
- Fault is past tense, choices already made 
- Responsibility is present tense, choices you’re currently making 
- Responsible for choosing present moment
