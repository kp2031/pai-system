Highest penetration

I am absolutely passionate about Electronics

I have basic store and online Merchandising skills that I would continue to quickly develop

I love this company and want to see it win again in GM, like we used and truly believe we can

If we make Electronics Omni now, we can leverage the full power Walmart and re-gain our fair share online and stop the accelerated bleeding in stores

There will be many problems to solve for, people, process and technology, which makes me the perfect fit, Iâ€™ve been solving problems, leading teams and developing talent for Walmart Canada for 10+ years, and loving it 

Please give me the chance, for my job to be restructured to become Omni, and to lead a fully integrated Omnichannel category management team

This is the perfect time to do this
