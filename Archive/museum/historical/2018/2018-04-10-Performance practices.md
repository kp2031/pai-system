**_Performance practices _**

Think of a skill you want to grow
Assess your current ability to perform this skill/capability 
Actively seek out challenges that just barely exceed your ability 
If you feel fully in control, make the next challenge a bit harder
If you feel anxious or so aroused that you canâ€™t focus, dial things down a notch 

= Just Manageable Challenges = Perfect Practice

Practice does not make perfect, _perfect practice_ makes perfect.
