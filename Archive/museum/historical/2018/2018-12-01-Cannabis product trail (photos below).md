Some cannabis facts:
- Recommended dose of THC (from the documentaries I’ve seen is 10mg)

- Stronger strains have a THC % of ~20%-25%
- Weaker strains will have a THC % of ~10%-15%

This is why people share joints (or smoke one over multiple days) and don’t smoke one entire one themselves:
- A typical home roll joint is ~0.5g-0.75g in weight and contains 50mg-200mg of THC depending on the cannabis flower-strain used 
- A typical store bought pre-roll is ~0.75g-1g and contains 75mg-250mg of THC depending on the cannabis flower-strain used 

- A typical 1oz (1oz = 28,350mg) of cannabis flower contains 2,835mg-7,090mg THC (10%-25% THC) which is 284-709 “servings”

THC spray:
- 24.7mg THC / ml
- 15ml bottle with 150 sprays per bottle
- Therefore, 1 spray dispenses 0.1ml 

- Therefore, 1 spray = 2.5mg of THC
- So a night out would be 2xSprays at 6pm and 2xSprays at 10pm
