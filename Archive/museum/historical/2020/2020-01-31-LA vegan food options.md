# LA # v# egan food options # 

Fine dining- Toca Madera. The food is SO good. The vegan churro ice cream is my fav dessert to this day. It’s upscale and will possibly bump into a celeb. Will have to make a reservation. You’ll really enjoy the cocktails here. 

Ambiance + environment- Gracias Madre. Overall the food is good, it’s generally always busy. We haven’t been in a while, so I can’t attest to the flavors being as awesome as the above mentioned. 

Fast service- Doomies Nextmex. It’s Mexican street food on crack. Kinda whole in the wall, but they have a fake meat option for every Mexican meat and it’s really cool. 

Fast service: Tocaya Organica- it’s Toca Madera’s sister restaurant. Everything is awesome, but def more of a lunch spot if you ask me.
