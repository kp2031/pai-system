Can you share an example of how you overcame a role mismatch? 
Are there many in HL or Elec?

How much control of marketing spend does a DM have? 
What's the most productive marketing tool to drive HL / Elec sales?

How much of the pilot D28 is because Rose is such a mature and strong Sr Dir?
What is the hurdle / timeline to expand the new roles & responsibilities to the full SBU or the entire Merch team (my preference)?

Do you have an opinion about if a DSV wants to switch to Marketplace (so they can control prices) but you want them to stay DSV to be able to control prices?

If you were to split my time between these three:
- Working/training store merchants 
- Finding and onboarding new products
- Managing day-to-day P&L

How would you ideally split it?

What individual on the store side will be the toughest for me? Vendor side? The HL&E eCom team?

Do you have any urgent asks of the technology team or are we empowered now to do our job?

In GM, we're going to be beat on price by amazon, how do you think we should compete?
