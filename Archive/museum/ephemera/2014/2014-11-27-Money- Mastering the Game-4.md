Save more and invest the difference
Earn more and invest the difference 
Reduced fees and taxes and invest the difference

Ray Dallio's balanced portfolio
(Note: stocks are 3x more risky as bonds)

Season **one**: rising economic growth
-- Stocks, corporate bonds, commodities / gold
Season **two**: rising inflation
-- Commodities / gold, inflation protected bonds (TIPs)
Season **three**: falling economic growth
-- treasury bonds, inflation protected bonds (TIPs)
Season **four**: deflation
-- treasury bonds, stocks

Portfolio allocation for all seasons:: 
30% in Stocks - S&P500 Index 
15% in 7-10 year Treasury bonds
40% in 20-25 year Treasury bonds
7.5% in Gold
7.5% in Commodities

1. Stocks: I will use VTI (Total Stock Market)
2. Intermediate US Bonds: I will use VGIT
3. Long Term US Bonds: I will use VGLT
4. Gold: Vanguard does not have a gold ETF. I propose using IAU (iShares Gold)
5. Commodities: Vanguard does not have anything. I propose using GSG (iShares Commodity)

Guaranteed income for life

"Complexity is the enemy of execution"

Annuities 
-- fixed deferred annuities - specific rate of return over a specific amount of time (5~10 years)
-- indexed annuity 
-- hybrid indexed annuity 

Longevity insurance (Advanced life deferred annuity) -- guaranteed annual income that kicks in after your 85 for life

Fixed indexed annuity -- 
100% Principal protection
Hire annual returns than CDs and bonds
Growth is tax-deferred
You don't go below 0% growth
Need to find one without a On returns but rather a fixed percentage that the insurance company takes 

How do insurance companies give you all the upside without any downside
- The insurance company party your money safely in its cash reserves never actually investing your money in the stock market - this is how they guarantee your principal - The remainder is used to buy options in the stock market and to cover expenses - then the insurance takes some of the return it is getting by using its own money - so if the market goes up you receive a portion of the gain - if it goes down the options expire and you don't lose and neither does the insurance company

What are the asset allocation percentages ray dalio recommends?

Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, is a highly successful investor known for his principles of radical transparency and his investment approach based on understanding and managing risk. In his book "Principles: Life and Work," he outlines his asset allocation strategy, which he calls the "All Weather" portfolio.
The All Weather portfolio is designed to perform well in any economic environment, whether it be inflationary, deflationary, or stagflation. Here are the asset allocation percentages that Dalio recommends for the All Weather portfolio:
1. 30% stocks: The All Weather portfolio includes a mix of U.S. and international stocks, with an emphasis on large-cap stocks with stable earnings and dividends.
2. 15% intermediate-term Treasury bonds: This asset class provides a source of stability and income, with low risk and low volatility.
3. 40% long-term Treasury bonds: Long-term Treasury bonds provide a source of diversification and protection against inflation, as their prices tend to rise when inflation is high.
4. 7.5% gold: Gold is a hedge against inflation and can provide protection during times of economic uncertainty.
5. 7.5% commodities: Commodities can provide diversification and protection against inflation, as their prices tend to rise when inflation is high.

It's worth noting that Dalio emphasizes the importance of tailoring the asset allocation percentages to one's individual goals and risk tolerance. He also advises investors to periodically rebalance their portfolios to maintain their desired asset allocation.
