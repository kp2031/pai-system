Dada had 4 mamas. His mother’s brothers, also living in Porda. One brother died young, he was married and had a daughter. The other three brothers are: Chunibhai, Motibhai, and Maganbhai. 

All were influenced in their youth by Gandhi with his Satyagraha movement of civil disobedience and passive resistance with truth force for the only way of convincing the European colonial masters to leave India. 

Imagine all of Africa, all of Asia, the West Indies nearly the whole world in the hands of these small European countries becoming enormously rich on the backs of the colonies.

Gandhi may not have been the first to plan the liberation movements. But while living in London during his studies for Law, he must have read about the American Revolution, the Emancipation of slavery, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution. 

All had one thing in common: the wealth in a nation was in the hands of the kings, the nobility and landlords. The masses struggled to survive, because the laws of the land were written to always favour the rich. 

So he after finishing his law studies he decides to practice in one of the British colonies, South Africa, where  in spite of being a lawyer and man of stature, he gets thrown out of a train because ‘coloured’ people were not allowed in that train compartment. And the seeds were sown in his mind for struggle to make a change at any cost.

I won’t dwell anymore, because just watch the movie ‘Gandhi’ for what happens next.

And all the other colonies around the world, British, French, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Italian etc. all got inspired by Gandhi’s success, and it was a domino effect.

So, back to Dada’s 3 surviving mamas. The families were not super wealthy, but doing well with their land, tobacco business etc.

The oldest, Chunibhai had four sons and two daughters. Chandubhai Babubhai Bhavsarbhai and Ashwinbhai. You remember well Ashwinkaka who lives in South Carolina. 

Next, Motibhai, who married twice, had three daughters and five sons. You know some of them. One of the daughters is Chandrikafoi, living in Baltimore. Oldest son Jitubhai, married to Jitendrafuva’s sister, father of Rahul who lives in Florida. Then Prafulkaka, then Kiritkaka, then Pinakinkaka in Baltimore, and Mukundkaka, living in Florida.

The youngest brother and Dada’s mama Maganbhai, has two sons, Vasantkaka and Natukaka who lives in Dubai. Maganbhai became a widow shortly after the birth of Natu.  In those days TB was like COVID-19, and also during childbirths, motherS dying was quite common.

Both the oldest Chunibhai and the youngest Maganbhai were both influenced by and drawn to Gandhi’s marches and nonviolent movement for independence.
And Dada lived his whole life from the time he was born with his maternal grandmother in Porda with his mamas, went to school there, fell in love with a local Porda girl, and went to Aden after finishing high school and marriage avec Vimla. 

Maganmama was already a manager in Antonio Besse’s imports/exports company. Maganmama also helped Jayantikaka come to Aden, and also helped nine or ten other young families to come over to work at A. Besse & Co.

One thing Gandhi inspired in his followers was to boycott the mills of Birmingham where all Indian cotton was exported and then resold as finished cloth to Indians at a higher price.

Gandhi said we will weave our own cotton fabric, and make white cotton clothes, for men and women, including the white cotton hat lovingly called Gandhi Topi. 

Those were heady days, with patriotic fever and patriotic songs and determination not just in India but Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rhodesia, Nigeria, Egypt, Palestine, Malaya, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, all followed in the footsteps of Gandhi of mostly nonviolent struggles for independence throughout the 1950s. 

And MLK learned from Gandhi and said we want equal treatment and voting rights, through the 50s and 60s. And Mandela followed in South Africa.

So, it is so DÉJÀ VU, when the Black Lives Matter movement gets inspiration from past struggles in bringing about change through a ‘revolution’, not ‘evolution’.

And Obama spoke eloquently and in simple easy to understand terms MLK’s and John Wilson’s struggles for equal rights. 

The French Revolution slogan was Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité. And I din’t know until today that it ended with ‘ou la mort’.

The Beatles got it right albeit a little in a softer and a nonviolent approach, when they wrote and sang Revolution in 1968: https://youtu.be/BGLGzRXY5Bw

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free you mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right

And the Rolling Stones got the message across so clearly in their song and lyrics for Sympathy for the Devil, also from 1968:  https://youtu.be/5cEXCc4Y-bg

The great French director Jean-Luc Godard made a movie of the Live Studio sessions of the Stones recording the song into a documentary with the same name, Sympathy for the Devil. I was lucky to see it in NYC in the summer of 1969.
