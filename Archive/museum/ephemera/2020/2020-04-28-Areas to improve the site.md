# Areas to improve the site

App
- first time user
	- New to Walmart (doesn’t know what rollbacks are)
	- New to App
- Frequent shopper - increase time browsing, favorit’ing & researching in app
- Push / communication hub - we can push communications like (1) 
- Search
	- Is this a reasonably easy search fix... when I type “camping” on mobile web search - I’m re-directed to our camping hierarchy landing and shelf page https://www.walmart.ca/en/N-1191 ... On iOS I can swipe down and open that page within the App and I get the shelf page with the correct ranking vs the ranking you get in the app which doesn’t redirect to the N-1191 shelf (and eventually, landing page)

Fast & Convenient 
- Speed of unregistered checkout 
- Speed of registered checkout 

Shopping / Finding 
- Where’s the closest Walmart with this item in stock ?
- What store can I get all (as many as possible) of these items the soonest 

Platform
- talk to Paula about her format design strategy
- How does 50k Supercentre SKUs look like on-site 
- 

- What are some parameters related to space and exposure?
- Balance between easy-and-fast-shopping and top-line-demand-nurturing (good items at great prices we want customers to buy) vs bottom line focus (media and sponsored item sales)

Technologies to help manage the customer experience 
- Intelligent collections 
	- Based on ship date: only show items that will arrive before x date e.g. I need my Valentine’s Day gift to arrive before Valentine’s Day
	- Based on discount: only show 80% of items in this collection with a discount less than 50% off 
	- Based on historical price: keep items in this collection at or below the price on x date (remove items from the collection if their prices go up by y%)

Create a proposition agnostic “platform” like Ali baba - website, fulfillment, distribution network, home delivery, pick-up, help centre

The ultimate one stop shop Supercentre!
