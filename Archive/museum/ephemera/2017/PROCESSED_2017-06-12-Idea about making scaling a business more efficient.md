# Idea: Efficient Business Scaling Through HR Automation

**Original Date**: June 12, 2017
**Status**: Seed idea - undeveloped

## Core Concept

Automate hiring and employee management to enable self-service scaling:

### Key Components
1. **Self-Service Onboarding**
   - Employees enter banking information electronically
   - Self-set objectives for 30/60/90 days
   - Performance self-reporting system

2. **Performance Management**
   - Quick performance tracking
   - Weekly payment cycles
   - Monthly/weekly performance conversations
   - 3-month performance-based retention decisions

## Analysis (2024 Perspective)

This idea anticipated several trends that became mainstream:
- **Self-service HR platforms** (BambooHR, Gusto, Rippling)
- **Continuous performance management** (replaced annual reviews)
- **Rapid feedback cycles** in startup culture
- **Gig economy** payment structures (weekly pay)

## Potential Applications
- Startup scaling playbook
- HR tech product concept
- Consulting framework for rapid scaling

## Questions to Explore
- What existing tools now solve this problem?
- How has remote work changed these needs?
- Could AI enhance this concept further?

## Next Actions
- [ ] Research current HR automation landscape
- [ ] Compare to modern tools like Rippling
- [ ] Consider if worth developing further

*Note: This idea from 2017 shows early thinking about problems that the HR tech industry has since addressed. Interesting to see how intuitions about business needs preceded market solutions.*
