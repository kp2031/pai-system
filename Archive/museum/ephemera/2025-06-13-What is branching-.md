**## What is branching?**
* **Main branch**: Your "official" version of the code (like the published book)
* **Feature branches**: Copies where you try new things (like draft chapters)
* **Merging**: Taking your changes from a branch and adding them to main

Examples

feature/user-login          # For new features
bugfix/login-error         # For fixing bugs  
hotfix/critical-security   # For urgent fixes
chore/update-dependencies  # For maintenance tasks

**Pattern: type/short-description**

**## 
**
**## How to use branches:**
1. Create a new branch for each task
2. Work on that branch
3. When done, merge it back to main
4. Delete the branch
