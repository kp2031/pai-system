Five step process

1. Brainstorm - all of the reasonable ways you can use each traction channel (at least one idea per channel) how probable doesn't seem that this idea could work? What is the expected cost to acquire a customer? How many customers can be acquired at that cost before reaching saturation? What is the timeframe needed to run tests?

Rank 
(A) Which traction channels seemed most promising right now 
(B) Which traction channels seem like they could possibly work
(C) Which traction channels seem like a longshot

Prioritize 
pick 3 from (A)

Test
1. Roughly how much will it cost to acquire customers through this channel
2. How many customers do you think are available through this channel
3. Are the customers you are getting through this channel of the ones that you want right now

Focus on what works

Product vs Traction
Users users wanted but you can't figure out the correct business model and users won't pay or click on advertisement - no market
you build something users want but just not enough users to reach profitability - small-market 
You build something users want but reaching them is cost prohibitive - hard to reach market
You build something users want but a lot of other companies do the same and it's too hard to get customers - competitive market

Three phases of start up
Phase 1, recruit customers manually
You have a product that resonates with customers, initial traction
Does not require sweeping product changes
Getting the first few customers
Small things can move the needle like a tweet from a well-respected individual, or A speech to a small group of individuals

Phase 2, established product market fit, fine-tuning marketing messages
Getting enough customers to be able to sustain your business

Phase 3, you have an established business model, significant position in the market, focused on scaling, to dominate the market and profit
Increasing earnings, scaling your marketing channels, creating a truly sustainable business

Questions to ask yourself
How much traction is enough for investors

Demand generation (social advertising) versus demand of harvesting (search advertising)

Look for remanent ads - do not have a buyer
