Retirement assumptions

1. Ability to retire by 55

2. Ability to live a very good life in perpetuity - equivalent to $250k annual in 2015 dollars

3. To do it in the most tax efficient way - drawing down RRSP first, then taxable savings, then TFSA (last)

4. To be able to give family members a living inheritance -- children $10k monthly that lasts in perpetuity after 55 years old (adj for inflation) -- $10k/mo to each grandchild after 55 years old - sis and bro $5k monthly gift in perpetuity at 55 years old   

5. To donate remaining into 3 charities in monthly contributions ($10k/mo each)
