Scrum by Jeff Sutherland

Cocreator with Ken Scheuber 20 years ago

To replace the waterfall method created during World War I to plan trench warfare

Scrum comes from rugby - The way a team works together to move the ball down the field: careful alignment, Unity of purpose, clarity of goal

Inspect and adapt cycle - 1. am I doing the right thing and 2. am I doing it in a way that as efficient as possible

Build into your working method The assumption of change, discovery and new ideas

Fail fast so you can fix early

Fighter pilot methodology: observe, orient, decide, act 

PDCA cycle 
Plan, do, check, act

Waterfall message
Assume that everything could be planned ahead of time, things wouldn't change over the course of a multiyear project
Even if you do execute this well because business-cycles get shorter and shorter or the end customer and not to want the product create after the one to two years of development

Great teams are cross functional, autonomous and empowered with a transcendent purpose

Don't guess ... plan, do, check, act

Plan what you're going to do
Do it
Check weather it did what you wanted
Act on that and change how you're doing things
Repeat in regular cycles - and by doing so, achieve continuous improvement

Teams

Daily check-in Ask three questions:
What did you do since the last time we talked?

What have you done since we last spoke? What will you do an till we speak again? What is getting in your way?

At the end of each sprint, ask two questions:
What can we change about the way we work?
What is our biggest sticking point?

Pull the right lever
Change team performance

Think about characters 
Who is this task being done for who is lens do we need to put on to view if we've done a good job

What...
What we want done

Motivation
Why does this character want what they want?

Ask these questions about stories:
Is the story ready?
How will you know when it's done?

Use the INVEST criteria to see if the story is ready::

Independent - The story must be actionable and completable on its own
Negotiable - until it is done it should be able to be changed
Valuable - it actually delivers value to customers or users
Estimable - you have to be able to size it
Small - The story has to be small enough to be able to estimate and plan for it easily, if it's too big, break it down
Testable - The story must have a test in order for it to be deemed complete, write the test before you complete the story

After a sprint ask three questions:

1. Is there anything we can be doing differently to speed things up?

2. Can we offload some backlog items / get other teams to do?

3. Can we not do something / Reducing the scope by any amount?

At the end of each sprint you want to ask each other:
1. On a scale from 1 to 5, how do you feel about your role in the company?
2.  On the same scale, how do you feel about the company as a whole?
3. Why do you feel that way?
4. What one thing would make you happier in the next sprint?

Product owner
Spend half your time with the customer what they like what they don't like about the current process and the other half of the time with the team creating the backlog

1. Pick a product owner - vision of what you want to accomplish - take into account risks and rewards - chapter 8

2. Pick a team - Who will actually be doing the work - 3-9 people - chapter 3

3. Pick a Scrum Master - coach the rest of the team for the scrum framework and help the team eliminate anything slowing them down

4. Create and prioritize a product backlog - A list at a high level of everything that needs to be built or done - exist and evolves through the life of the product - it is the product roadmap - The single definitive view of everything that can ever be done by the team ever - only a single product backlog exist - The product owner makes prioritize Asian decisions across the backlog - chapter 8

5. Refine & estimate (in points) the product backlog - people who are going to complete the items in the backlog estimate their effort - do not estimate in hours - use the invest criteria - estimate by relative size small medium large or even better using the Fibonacci sequence 1, 2, 3, 5 8, 13

6. Sprint planning - fixed length in time ~1-2 weeks - sprint goal - looks at the top of the backlog, how much of it can be completed by the team, start with the number of points completed in the previous Sprint - discuss how these items will help fulfill the product vision and discuss a goal to accomplish for this sprint

7. Make work visible - to-do, doing, done - create a burn down chart for each sprint

8. Daily stand up - The heartbeat of scrum - 15 minutes - what did you do yesterday to help the team complete the sprint? What will you do today to help the team finished the sprint? Is there any obstacles preventing you or the team from completing the sprint goal? - held the whole team understand where everything is in the Sprint - or all the time going to be completed on time? How can I help other team members overcome obstacles? 

9. Sprint review - team shows (to all stakeholders and management) what has been accomplished during that sprint - The team should only "demo" what meets the definition of done - totally and completely finished and can be "delivered"

10. Sprint retrospective - what went right? What could have been better? What is the improvement in the process we can implement right away? Must agree on one process improvements to implement in the next sprint - add it to the backlog with specific acceptance criteria

11. Immediately start the next sprint cycle
