# Idea: clearance castle

The concept is that by law retailers can only show you the last price on a clearance item with a strikethrough. They cannot show the original price with a strikethrough, and so the app would store the original price and all of the markdowns that happened on that item from the original price and call out items that are 25% off or more from the original price

It would scrape top big box retailers that have to purchase huge volumes of inventory and then at the end of the season clearance those items so they can make room for the next season

This is a typical inventory management tactic

The key to this business is that most of the retailers do not have the ability to show the original price and then the next price and then the next price and then the next price all the way down

We would simply build a business based on an affiliate program to start off, so there’s no inventory required

There can be auto generated YouTube videos weekly

And a paid program to get alerts on items that you’re following as soon as the price drops to the level you’re looking for
