Options trading

Stock price
- unpredictable 

Time 
- options are always decaying 

Volatility
- predictable

If the markets are random, how do we make money?
1. Put time decay in our favour
2. Put the probabilities in our favour
3. Take advantage of our volatility edge (taking advantage of how volatility is priced into options pricing - I think your edge within Black-shoals)

What you need to learn to become a consistently profitable trader:
- correct _strategies_ to use 
- _When_ to use them
- correct position sizing based on account size
- When to take _profits_

- How and when to _defend_ losing trades
- The relationship between probability of success and ROC

Call (buyer metaphor - call a vendor to get a lower cost)
- Strike price (strike a deal with the vendor) = the cost price you buy your stock from the vendor 
- Stock price = the price you sell your stock to the customer 

Put (retail metaphor - put it on shelf)
- Stock price = cost price 
- Strike price (strike a deal with a customer) = customer price 

_Out of the money_

- Call (a vendor) - **strike** a cost from vendor that's **higher** than **stock** value to sell
- Put (it on the shelf) - **strike** a sale that's **lower** than **stock** cost you

_Vertical spread - most basic option spread_
examples:
- Iron condor
- Butterfly
- Back ratio 

_what is it?_
- The combination of a long option and a short option at different strikes with the same expiration date - can be bought or sold
- Short vertical spread: sell time premium with very little capital and defined risk
- Sell a $100 call option at $3 and 
- Buy a $105 call option at $1.20
- We care about the net profit of the trade not how each leg does
- So if the stock stays below $100 then we make a $300 profit on the Sell $100 Call and a $120 loss on the Buy $105 Call == $$180 profit

_Sky view trading _
1. Buy into weakness. To sell into strength. (it's the opposite of what most traders do)
2. Book your profits. Patient with losing trades. (all losing trades become winning trades at some point)
3. Keep your position sizes small.  (Day to day fluctuations make you make bad decisions)
4. Reduce your cost basis (by placing trades with a defined profit strategy)

Watch out! 
- Analyze how much your Trading strategy + brokers commission drag … Will cost you
- Initial stop loss… Trailing stop loss… create rules that will help guide your execution… Never lose more than 1% of total account size on any given trade
- How do you adjust your position size based on the volatility of the stock

Covert call
Via stock and lower your cost basis by selling mall that is the closest out of the money in the nearest month in time
