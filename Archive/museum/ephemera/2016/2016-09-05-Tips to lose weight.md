Tips to lose weight 

1. Set a goal - Kavi: 140, Pri: 115 + Kavi: 45min 10km, Pri: 30min 5km
2. Clear the clutter off the kitchen counters - easier to prepare healthy foods 
3. Eat at home more often 
4. Increase metabolism by sleeping more - sleep deprivation increases fat storing hormone cortisol - Lack of sleep also causes fluctuations in the hunger hormones leptin and ghrelin, which indicate whether youâ€™re full or hungry
5. Vary your fitness routine - vary the body part you're focused on
6. Eat more calories at breakfast and less at dinner 
7. Rethink what is delicious - think positively of foods that are healthy for you often
8. Don't skip meals or snacks - it throws off control later in the day, causes indulging 
9. Get support from friends and family 
10. Stop dieting - it doesn't work, think long-term not short-term
