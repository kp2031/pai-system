Code Quality Consistency File

**Pro tip:** Start your conversations with AI assistants by saying "Please read CODING_STANDARDS.md in the project root before starting any work."

Create a CODING_STANDARDS.md file

# Project Coding Standards

## Code Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Always use const/let, never var
- Use descriptive variable names (getUserData not gUD)

## Documentation
- Every function needs a comment explaining what it does
- Complex logic should have inline comments

## File Organization
- Components go in `/components` folder
- Utilities go in `/utils` folder
- Tests go next to the files they test

## AI Assistant Instructions
When working on this project:
1. Read this file first
2. Follow these conventions exactly
3. Ask for clarification if something is unclear
