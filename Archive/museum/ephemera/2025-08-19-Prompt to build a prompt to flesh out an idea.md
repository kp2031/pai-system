# Prompt to build a prompt to flesh out an idea 

Can you help me build a detailed prompt to flesh this website idea idea? I’d like to turn this into a company that runs itself using ai and ai automations after I get it going. By getting it going I mean do some work like build a headless YouTube channel (for continuous video content and inspiration and customer acquisition), write a book and publish it on Amazon (for credibility), create an x account so I can post something daily, and more. And of course create the website that helps people. I want people to get a ton of value from this. So please, I’m fully open to creating as much as possible to begin with to get this going, but then want the business to evolve and be maintained fully automatically. So open to lots of discovery and options. 

The goal is to generate a very detailed prompt that I can put into ChatGPT 5 Pro and for the output to be a fully fleshed out and very detailed business strategy including strategic choices that I need to make to set this up correctly. It should also do some deep customer persona analysis. It should do some deep company competitive analysis that identifies the top 3 companies that may be doing the same thing similar. And to identify the top 10 influencers in this space that I could partner with to promote the company. I’m fully open to exploring 3 different pricing methods so please propose. The prompt that you provide should help me generate a pdf document that would be as good as something McKinsey & co would create. 

So here’s the idea.
