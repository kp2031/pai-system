Don’t try to be who you’re not
- what’s the point of driving online sales 
- Margins are lower
- If you’re not serving your stores
- What’s the point 

Don’t measure ROAS
- focus on offline conversion 

Who you are (store retailer) - not who you’re not (online pure play)

Physical stores - traffic 

Do all proofs on Mobile
Product listing Ads - visual search = mobile

Mobile is local, local drives store 

Online drives store 

Smart shopping is perfect for in-house marketing
