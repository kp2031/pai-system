# Leaders guide

Lean startup methodology 
1. Identify the opportunity from the point of view of the customer
	1. Who will care about what wrote building cares?
2. Identify both commercial and technical leap of faith assumptions about how to solve the problem
	1. Critical to the solution, if any were invalid, failure would be certain
3. Create a series of experiments to test those assumptions
	1. These are minimum viable products, these deliver the most learning in the least time
4. Transform what’s been learned, from these experiments, into learning metrics
	1. Innovation accounting involves replacing vanity metrics with learning metrics based on actual customer behavior, to demonstrate progress
5. Use those learning metrics to make decisions to change strategy, pivot, or preserve down the path in regularly scheduled pivot or preserve meetings
	1. Changing strategy is not a failure, it’s a natural part of the process

Hindsight bias - The tendency to believe we were always right and events are more predictable than they truly are

Make a habit about recording your expectations about any interaction with the customer

This way we are reminded that we won’t always be right, and that’s OK - this technique puts us in the appropriate mindset for working in situations of extreme uncertainty

Six tools to follow (to find out who customers are and what they want):
1.  identify customers - anyone we hope will find value in our idea/product to make some kind of investment in it (any one whose approval is required)
2.  stay focused on what to build by discovering what really matters to customers - ask imperial behavior questions not leading questions
3. Decide which MVPs to test

3 engines of growth
The faster the loop turns, the better the engine is tuned and the faster the business will grow
1. Sticky engine of growth - track the churn rate, the fraction of customers in a given period, who fail to remain engaged, carefully - if the rate of new customer acquisition exceeds the churn rate, the product will grow - the speed of growth is determined by the rate of compounding, equal to  natural growth rate minus churn — Focus on existing customers and improve customer retention
2. Viral engine of growth -  depends on the person to person transmission as a consequence of each new customer that signs up — powered by a viral feedback loop - Bead is determined by the viral coefficient (equals how many new customers will use the product as a consequence of each new customer that signs up)  this number has to be greater than one
3. Paid engine of growth -  increase revenue from each customer or drive down the cost of acquisition of new customers - each customer pays a certain amount of money for the product over his or her lifetime, One theory of all costs are deducted, this is called lifetime value

3 horizons framework

1. Profit horizon - brand name, operations - exiting of profit focused activities - make our numbers, hit our sales targets, take our existing products and improve them and extend them into other markets 
2. Growth horizon (before 1.) - we don’t spring out of the earth fully formed, something has to grow before we profit, sacrifice profitability for - market share, top line revenue - you lose money in the near term, but make a lot of profit in the farther term - need to have in place because if you wait, until your horizon 1 goes away, too late to start it up, because before horizon 2 comes horizon 3
3. Innovation horizon (before 2.) - trying a whole lot of new tactics and approaches, some work, some don’t - before something can get in horizon 2, it has to exist 

70% activities in horizon 1
20% activities in horizon 2
1% activities in horizon 3
