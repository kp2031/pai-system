The Benefits of Rehearsing Public Speaking: Insights from Scientific Literature

## Overview

Practicing or rehearsing before public speaking is a widely recommended strategy, believed to reduce anxiety and physiological arousal—especially heart rate—during the actual performance. Scientific literature provides evidence on both the physiological and psychological benefits of rehearsal and repeated exposure, including effects on heart rate, anxiety, and performance quality.

## Physiological Effects: Heart Rate and Anxiety

### Reduced Heart Rate through Repeated Exposure

- **Studies consistently show that multiple rehearsals or exposure sessions lower heart rate (HR) responses during public speaking.** Virtual reality-based exposure and rehearsal sessions led participants to experience HR levels returning toward baseline after several practice rounds[1][2].
- In music performance (which has similar psychological and physiological stressors as public speaking), repeated stage exposure significantly decreased HR and restlessness, supporting habituation—the process where repeated exposure dulls the physiological alarm response[3].

### Mechanisms of Heart Rate Reduction

- **Habituation and Emotional Regulation:** Repeated practice creates familiarity, which signals safety to the body and reduces autonomic (fight-or-flight) responses. This is reflected in both subjective anxiety ratings and physiological measures like HR[1][4][2].
- **Embodied and Simulation Techniques:** Programs that combine rehearsal with embodied strategies—such as body awareness, gesture enhancement, and practice in realistic contexts—lead to both significant reductions in self-reported anxiety and measurable HR decreases (e.g., 4.7% HR reduction, 33% anxiety reduction)[4][5].
- Traditional practice and simulated public speaking, including rehearsal with tools such as speech outlines or remote video-based awareness training, also contributed to lower HR and anxiety during presentations[6].

## Broader Benefits of Rehearsing Before Public Speaking

### 1. Improved Confidence and Willingness

- **Boosted Confidence:** Studies show that rehearsal increases speaker confidence and willingness to perform, further buffering against anxiety and elevated HR during actual presentations[1][7].
- Participants practicing with feedback and in simulated environments report greater comfort and perceived public speaking ability, reducing the negative impact of anxiety on both mind and body[6].

### 2. Decreased Performance Errors

- **Performance Quality:** Repetition reduces behavioral symptoms of anxiety, such as disfluency or motor restlessness, and improves the overall fluency and organization of delivery. This translates to fewer mistakes and smoother performance during the real event[3][6].

### 3. Enhanced Emotional Regulation and Cognitive Control

- **Neural Activation:** Functional brain studies reveal that rehearsal and embodied exposure increase activation in cortical regions related to emotion regulation and sensorimotor control, which contributes to calmer delivery and less physiological reactivity[4][5].
- **Self-Perception:** Improved self-perceived control and emotional management reduces negative self-feedback, further lowering stress responses.

### 4. Potential for Long-Lasting Adaptation

- **Retention of Benefits:** Even single session interventions, when involving realistic and immersive rehearsal (like VR simulations), can establish a pattern of reduced HR and anxiety, which often persists beyond the rehearsal session[1][2].

## Key Data Points from Research

| Study/Intervention              | HR Reduction                                   | Other Benefits                              |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Virtual Reality (VRE) rehearsal | Significant HR drop to baseline[1]             | Reduced anxiety, higher willingness[1]      |
| Corp-Oral program (simulation + embodiment) | HR ↓ 4.7%, anxiety ↓ 33%[4][5]            | Improved emotional/cognitive control        |
| Music/performance repeated exposure         | Marked HR reduction, fewer mistakes[3]    | Calmness, better performance                |
| Video-based rehearsal           | Reported HR/anxiety reduction[6]               | Greater comfort and confidence              |

## Conclusion

**Rehearsing public speaking, especially through realistic simulation and repeated exposure, reliably reduces heart rate and anxiety.** This effect arises from mechanisms of habituation, improved emotional regulation, and boosted confidence. Additional benefits include higher speaking performance, fewer errors, and durable reductions in physiological stress responses. Scientific evidence strongly supports integrating rehearsal—especially in settings that mimic real performance—into any public speaking preparation routine[1][4][2][3][6].
