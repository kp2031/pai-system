# Effects of Rehearsal on Heart Rate and Other Benefits in Public Speaking

Effects of Rehearsal on Heart Rate and Other Benefits in Public Speaking

## Heart Rate Reduction and Rehearsal

Scientific studies consistently show that public speaking triggers physiological stress responses, most notably an increase in heart rate—an expression of anxiety and the body's "fight-or-flight" reaction[1][2]. However, structured rehearsal and embodied preparation techniques have been shown to **significantly reduce both heart rate and subjective anxiety in speakers**[3][2].

### Key Findings from Scientific Literature

- **Empirical Evidence of Heart Rate Reduction**: Interventions that include rehearsal, body awareness, and simulated practice led to a measurable decrease in heart rate during public speaking. In one controlled study (Corp-Oral program), university students who’d undergone multiple sessions of embodied rehearsal techniques exhibited a significant reduction in heart rate during their final speeches compared to control groups. The reduction in self-perceived anxiety was about 33%, while heart rate dropped by nearly 5%[3].
- **Heart Rate Variability as a Stress Indicator**: Research confirms that higher heart rate variability (HRV) is correlated with less public speaking stress. Practicing the speech, especially under realistic or elevated stress conditions, improves HRV and reduces overall heart stress during the performance[2].
- **Physiological Desensitization**: The more frequently a person rehearses in conditions similar to the actual speaking event (simulated audience, timed drills), the more their body adapts, resulting in lower heart rate spikes and less acute anxiety[4][5].

## Broader Benefits of Rehearsal for Public Speaking

### 1. Reduced Performance Anxiety
- Regular rehearsal, especially with embodied or simulation techniques, reduces not just physiological symptoms (heart rate, sweating) but also subjective feelings of nervousness and fear[3][6].

### 2. Improved Content Mastery and Delivery
- Rehearsed speakers are better at remembering the structure and details of their speech, reducing cognitive load during the actual event and allowing them to focus more on engaging the audience[6][5].
- This leads to **fewer speech disfluencies** (pauses, filler words) and improved clarity[7].

### 3. Higher Confidence and Presence
- Practicing in varied or challenging contexts (such as in front of peers, with distractions, or under time limits) builds confidence, enabling speakers to be more poised and energetic on stage[5][8].
- Rehearsal frees up cognitive resources, allowing speakers to connect emotionally with their material and audience, rather than focusing internally on fear[8].

### 4. Enhanced Physical and Vocal Control
- Multiple rehearsals allow speakers to develop effective pacing, controlled gestures, and better vocal projection, leading to a more engaging delivery[6].
- Practiced breathing and posture techniques further reduce heart rate and outward anxiety symptoms[9][10].

### 5. Positive Audience Perception
- Well-rehearsed speakers are perceived as more credible, authoritative, and trustworthy, which increases the impact of their message[6][11].

### 6. Adaptability and Improvisational Skill
- Extensive rehearsal allows for better improvisation when facing unexpected situations, such as technical difficulties or tough audience questions[5][6].

## Table: Summary of Benefits of Rehearsal Before Public Speaking

| Benefit                            | Description                                                                                | Scientific Support         |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Reduced Heart Rate & Anxiety        | Measurable decrease in heart rate and self-perceived anxiety after multiple rehearsals      | [3][2][10]                 |
| Improved Speech Performance         | Fewer mistakes, greater message clarity, smoother delivery                                 | [5][6][7]                |
| Increased Confidence                | Enhanced self-assurance and emotional regulation during presentation                       | [3][5][8]                |
| Better Audience Engagement          | More dynamic delivery and greater audience attention                                       | [6][5]                   |
| Enhanced Physical & Vocal Skills    | Mastery of pacing, gestures, and breathing to control anxiety                              | [10][9][6]               |
| Greater Adaptability                | Ability to adjust content and manage unforeseen events smoothly                            | [5][6]                   |

## Summary

Rehearsing public speaking—in authentic, progressively challenging, or simulated environments—provides both physiological and psychological benefits. The most prominent physiological benefit, confirmed by rigorous scientific studies, is a reduction in heart rate during the speaking event, reflecting lower anxiety. Rehearsal also boosts confidence, sharpens performance, and builds resilience for handling public speaking stress[3][5][6].
