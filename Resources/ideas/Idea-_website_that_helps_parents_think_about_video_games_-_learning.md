# Idea: website that helps parents think about video games - learning…

# Idea: website that helps parents think about video games - learning dimensions - no ads, no affiliate links - $1/month, $10/yr 

Automate website updating with a gen ai script

Think about the parenting dimensions like strategy, math, language, science, logic, hand eye coordination, short / long term planning, quick thinking 

Pick x number of dimensions and create a secret formula / heuristic so it’s not replicable - that provides a score for each game

Have a dimension of “verified by real gamers” - ask Paul about this - to give it real credibility

Give the gist and answer for free but if the parent wants to know the research, it’s behind the pay wall

Good idea / bad idea? The most popular 100 games (as benchmarked off x website) are free detailed reports - everything else is being a pay wall
