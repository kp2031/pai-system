# Idea - family values builder app

An app that helps parents articulate what their top 5 values are in terms / language and tone that they use / for the purpose of first and continuously aligning what the stack ranking of values should be for the family and then second, for communicating the aligned values with their child(ren) in a way that simplifies those values for every developmental state of the kid - same values but it evolves every year since the kid is evolving and understanding new things every year / and an optional leather bound booklet keepsake for the family to use as a teaching prop throughout the year / right before the new years

Strategy building prompt:

Can you help me build a detailed prompt to flesh this website idea idea? I’d like to turn this into a company that runs itself using ai and ai automations after I get it going. By getting it going I mean do some work like build a headless YouTube channel (for continuous video content and inspiration and customer acquisition), write a book and publish it on Amazon (for credibility), create an x account so I can post something daily, and more. And of course create the website that helps people. I want people to get a ton of value from this. So please, I’m fully open to creating as much as possible to begin with to get this going, but then want the business to evolve and be maintained fully automatically. So open to lots of discovery and options. 

The goal is to generate a very detailed prompt that I can put into ChatGPT 5 Pro and for the output to be a fully fleshed out and very detailed business strategy including strategic choices that I need to make to set this up correctly. It should also do some deep customer persona analysis. It should do some deep company competitive analysis that identifies the top 3 companies that may be doing the same thing similar. And to identify the top 10 influencers in this space that I could partner with to promote the company. I’m fully open to exploring 3 different pricing methods so please propose. 

So here’s the idea. 

Family values builder app

An app that helps parents articulate what their top 5 values are in terms / language and tone that they use / for the purpose of first and continuously aligning what the stack ranking of values should be for the family and then second, for communicating the aligned values with their child(ren) in a way that simplifies those values for every developmental state of the kid - same values but it evolves every year since the kid is evolving and understanding new things every year / and an optional leather bound booklet keepsake for the family to use as a teaching prop throughout the year / right before the new years 

My idea is that it costs something high, like $49 USD for the first month, and then $9.99 annual subscription - so that I can weed out anyone that’s not serious about doing this.
