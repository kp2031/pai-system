# Idea: an app that you can upload your website or app to that builds…

# Idea: an app that you can upload your website or app to that builds the equivalent of figma flows / user journeys  

Since there’s a rise of vibe coding… 

And then vibe coding outputs something that may not work for a real human

There’s a need to turn a vibe coding output into user journeys 

Those user journeys should be able to be generated by pointing to a git-hub repo

It then takes screenshots of every screen and builds flows … e.g. when you click on X link… it goes to Y screen
