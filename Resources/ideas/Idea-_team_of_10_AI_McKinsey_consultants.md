# Idea: team of 10 AI McKinsey consultants 

Can you think deeply about this situation, take your time, take as long as you need to for your answer to be very strategic, comprehensive. 

I'd like to build an app that acts as if it is a 10 person high performance team of McKinsey consultants a managing partner, another partner, an engagement manager and 2 sr. analysts and 5 analysts. Please recommend if you think it's best to build this as a set of 10 AI agents with very well defined roles to get any job done. I want to be able to build these agents, and then give them various tasks. Like how they break down a business case for adding a pay as you go solution to an $1bn ecommerce site, or how to acquire a smaller company that has technology that another larger company needs to compete with it's biggest rival. You get the point, I want to create an application that has these 10 ai agents and the output is always a presentation slide deck. 
Essentially what i want to create is the equivalent of having a 10 person McKinsey team on retainer at all times that i can give any topic to and how long i need the output presentation to be, e.g. in 1 slide, or in 5 slides or in 10 slides. this is the project that i want to start. i'm very open to how this is done. 
i'm not particular about the file format of the output, but i'd like to eventually get the slides into powerpoint. The output is always a powerpoint or equivalent slide deck and an accompanying executive summary white paper ms word or equivalent document that’s less than 3 pages long

Can you also build a very simple, professional website using tailwindcss components? 

This is just one way of thinking about this application in a way that can keep costs low, since I’m the only one that’s going to be using it.
I have access to ChatGPT o3-pro, so consider building this in a way that I input my situation or need into a text dialogue box, the application uses ChatGPT o3-pro API to generate a super detailed prompt for me to then click a button and copy the prompt, that I will input into my ChatGPT desktop application using o3-pro. Then I take the output from the prompt and input it back into the application, upon which the application will turn the output into a slide deck. So the prompt that goes into o3, has to output something that the application can read, parse, digest and build a very professional presentation. And after the input from ChatGPT o3-pro has been inputted for presentation creation, after the presentation is created, a “Download Presentation” button would become enabled. This would allow me to download the presentation.

I’d like you to think about how we can take this and turn it into a super super detailed product requirements document called PROJECT_VISION.md

(Output below in Appendix A)

—————

I'd like to test a few things:
the ability to prompt Chatgpt o3-pro (using my pro account) to prepare itself to generate a prompt 
the prompt it generates will allow me to input what my situation or topic is and how many slides i need as an output
then after i input my situation or topic and the number of slides i need
then i need to figure out a way to simulate the 10 person McKinsey team using a series of prompts, maybe? what do you recommend? 

Ultimately, I want to be able to test if this concept of a 10 person team can actually breakdown a situation/problem well from the partner's role to the manager's role, to the analysts roles.

So is it best for ChatGPT o3-pro to get all of these instructions of the 10 person McKinsey team in the first prompt, before i've given it my situation? 

Because, then, I want to be able to receive 2 super specific json files which one create a powerpoint slide deck with the number of slides i asked for and the second json file will create the word document. 

Can you please help me think through how i can test the heart of my idea just using my chatgpt pro account since that would be essentially free? And then i have a pro account now for claude, and as of june 2025, and love using claude code, and i use claude code inside of a free cursor account. using cursor as the ide, and using cursor's terminal to launch and use claude code. I can use this setup to build the simple web application that inputs the json file and turns it into a pptx file.

I need help thinking through how i should set this up, please share 3 options so I can pick which i'm most comfortable with.

——Appendix A———

**PROJECT_VISION.md**

*(Product‑requirements document for an “always‑on McKinsey‑caliber consulting team” powered by 10 specialized AI agents)*

⸻

**1. Vision**

Deliver a single‑user SaaS application that feels like having a full, 10‑person McKinsey engagement team on retainer. The user types a business problem and desired slide‑count; the system returns:
	•	**A polished presentation deck** (PowerPoint .pptx)
	•	**A ≤3‑page executive summary** (.docx or Markdown)

All outputs are produced in minutes, at a fraction of the cost of human consultants.

⸻

**2. Goals & Objectives**

**Goal**	**Success Metric**	**Target**

10× faster strategy deck creation	Time from prompt → downloadable .pptx	≤ 15 min
McKinsey‑level structure & rigor	Average user quality rating (1‑5)	≥ 4.5
Predictable cost	Avg. inference cost per request	< US $1
Zero‑setup UX	Steps from home page → deck	≤ 4 clicks

⸻

**3. Product Strategy**

	1.	**Multi‑agent decomposition** – Mirror the real consulting hierarchy (Partner, EM, Sr. Analysts, Analysts) to split strategy problems into coherent workstreams.
	2.	**Prompt‑in / Prompt‑out loop** – Use o3‑pro to *generate* a second‑order prompt that the user copies into ChatGPT Desktop (keeping API usage minimal).
	3.	**Deterministic parsing** – Constrain the ChatGPT output to a strict JSON schema that the app can reliably transform into slides and prose.
	4.	**Low‑code presentation generation** – Convert JSON → .pptx with the python‑pptx library to stay server‑side and avoid Office automation licensing  .
	5.	**Static, inexpensive front‑end** – Host a TailwindCSS site (e.g., Vite + HyperUI components) on a free tier platform  .

⸻

**4. Personas**

**Persona**	**Needs**	**Pain Points**

**Founder/Strategist** (single user)	Top‑tier slides on demand; ability to tweak agent roles; cost control	Slow manual research; design polish; consultants are expensive

⸻

**5. Agent Team Concept**

**Role**	**Core Responsibility**	**LLM System Prompt Snippet**

**Managing Partner**	Frame the overall problem; set hypothesis tree	“You are the Partner in charge. Produce the governing *Issue Tree* and work‑plan.”
**Engagement Partner**	Stress‑test hypotheses; enforce MECE	“Challenge every branch for overlap or gap.”
**Engagement Manager**	Turn hypotheses into workstreams and deadlines	“Assign modules to analysts; specify outputs & slide storyline.”
**2 Sr. Analysts**	Deep research, modelling, primary insights	“For your module, output facts, sources, charts to build.”
**5 Analysts**	Data pulling, competitor benchmarks, visuals	“Produce bullet packs, table data, footnotes.”

**Implementation choices**

**Option**	**Pros**	**Cons**	**Recommendation**

**Single‑agent (monolithic)**	Simpler orchestration	Harder to scale depth; longer prompts	❌
**10 isolated agents**	Faithful hierarchy; reusable skills	More tokens, context syncing	◯
**Crew‑style multi‑agent orchestration (CrewAI or LangGraph)**	Built‑in role, memory & tool routing; token‑efficient; async	Slight learning curve	**✅** Use CrewAI for lightweight orchestration    with LangGraph for future extensibility  

⸻

**6. System Architecture**

⸻

**7. Data Contracts**

**7.1 JSON Schema returned by ChatGPT Desktop**

{
  "title": "Pay‑As‑You‑Go Strategy",
  "slide_count": 5,
  "slides": [
    {
      "title": "Objective & Approach",
      "bullets": ["Clarify value drivers", "Estimate TAM", "Assess cannibalization"],
      "chart": null,
      "notes": "Speaker notes..."
    },
    ...
  ],
  "exec_summary": "### Overview\n<500‑word markdown here>",
  "citations": [{"id":1,"url":"https://...","label":"McKinsey Global Payments 2024"}]
}

**Validation**

	•	JSON must conform; otherwise the “Upload” button remains disabled.
	•	Max tokens: 8 k for JSON plus summary (well inside o3‑pro limits).

⸻

**8. Functional Requirements**

**#**	**Requirement**	**Priority**

**F‑01**	Generate a bespoke “Working Prompt” including agent reasoning chain and output schema	P0
**F‑02**	Accept user‑pasted JSON, validate, and transform into .pptx	P0
**F‑03**	Generate ≤3‑page executive summary from same JSON	P0
**F‑04**	Provide progress indicators & error messaging	P1
**F‑05**	Store recent projects (local IndexedDB)	P2

⸻

**9. Non‑Functional Requirements**

**Category**	**Requirement**

**Performance**	End‑to‑end ≤15 min on home broadband
**Cost**	< US $0.10 per 1‑slide project; < US $1 per 10‑slide
**Security**	No data leaves secure backend; HTTPS; env‑keyed OpenAI creds
**Scalability**	Multi‑tenant ready (future) by containerizing each microservice
**Compliance**	SOC 2 aligned logging; GDPR data deletion endpoint

⸻

**10. Tech Stack**

**Layer**	**Tech**

Front‑end	Vite + React + TailwindCSS; components from HyperUI/HeadlessUI  
Orchestration	Python 3.12, CrewAI ≥ 0.9, LangChain 0.3, LangGraph 0.1 β   
LLM	OpenAI ChatGPT o3‑pro (via REST)
Slide Builder	python‑pptx 0.6
Doc Builder	docx4python or python‑docx 1.2
Hosting	Fly.io (API) + Cloudflare Pages (static)
Storage	Cloudflare R2 (cheap egress)
Auth (future)	Supabase auth or Clerk.dev

⸻

**11. Prompt Engineering Best Practices**

	1.	**System → Partner**: “Adopt the mindset of a McKinsey Managing Partner…”
	2.	**Examples**: Include mini‑worked example for structure‐aware few‑shot learning.
	3.	**Output format instructions**: Show full JSON schema and add "# END_OF_JSON" sentinel so parsing is trivial.
	4.	**Token discipline**: Each agent’s responses capped; internal scratchpad cleared before final JSON. See OpenAI prompt‑engineering guide  .

⸻

**12. Key User Flows**

**12.1 “Create Deck”**

	1.	Home → text box (problem + slide count) → **Generate Prompt**

	2.	Prompt modal opens; user clicks **Copy**

	3.	User pastes into ChatGPT desktop, runs, copies JSON result
	4.	Back to app → **Paste JSON & Build Deck**

	5.	Progress bar (server‑side build) → **Download Presentation / Executive Summary**

*(Optional future: replace steps 2–3 by calling o3‑pro directly via API to eliminate the manual loop.)*

⸻

**13. Cost Model (illustrative)**

**Component**	**$ per 1 k tokens**	**Typical tokens**	**Cost**

Prompt #1 (orchestration)	$0.002	2 k	$0.004
ChatGPT run (desktop)	n/a (user plan)	8 k	n/a
Slide build (python‑pptx)	CPU only	—	negligible
**Total / 5‑slide deck**	—	—	**≈ $0.004** (server)

⸻

**14. MVP Scope & Timeline**

**Sprint**	**Deliverable**

**0** (1 wk)	Repo setup, Tailwind landing, OpenAI key mgmt
**1** (2 wks)	Prompt generator microservice; schema validator
**2** (2 wks)	python‑pptx slide builder + download endpoint
**3** (1 wk)	Executive summary generator
**4** (1 wk)	UX polish, HyperUI components, deploy preview
**5** (1 wk)	Beta test & iterate

⸻

**15. Risks & Mitigations**

**Risk**	**Impact**	**Mitigation**

LLM output deviates from schema	Parser fails	Enforce JSON mode + sentinel; unit tests on few‑shot examples
Token explosion with 10 agents	Higher cost	Use hierarchical summaries, shared memory store
Legal concerns over strategy advice	Liability	Add Terms of Use; disclaimers; no confidential data ingestion

⸻

**16. Success Metrics (post‑MVP)**

	•	≥ 90 % “deck generated successfully” rate
	•	≤ 1 support ticket per 50 projects
	•	Net Promoter Score > 60

——Appendix B———

**## Below are three concrete ways you can test the core idea entirely with the tools you already have (ChatGPT o3‑pro, Claude Pro/Code, Cursor IDE)—before you invest time in a full‑blown web service.**

⸻
**## 
**
**1 | Single‑Prompt “All‑in‑One” Test**

**Aspect**	**Details**

**What you do**	Paste one large prompt into ChatGPT o3‑pro that:1. **Defines the 10 McKinsey roles** and their responsibilities.2. **Specifies the two JSON schemas** (deck + white‑paper).3. Includes *place‑holders* for {{TOPIC}} and {{SLIDE_COUNT}} that you fill in at run time.
**Prompt skeleton**	text<br>System: “You are an orchestrator coordinating a 10‑person McKinsey‑caliber team… [role descriptions].<br>When I supply TOPIC and SLIDE_COUNT, do the following in order: …<br>• Output JSON_A that conforms exactly to <PPT_SCHEMA>.<br>• Output JSON_B that conforms exactly to <DOC_SCHEMA>.<br>Return nothing else.”<br>User: “TOPIC = {{TOPIC}}; SLIDE_COUNT = {{SLIDE_COUNT}}”
**Manual steps**	1. Fill placeholders → run.2. Copy JSON_A and JSON_B to files.
**What it proves**	• Can a *single* instruction block make o3‑pro think hierarchically?• Are both JSONs syntactically valid in one shot?• How big does the prompt get?
**Pros**	• Fastest to try (one message).• No context‑switch cost.
**Cons**	• Large prompt every run (≈8–10 k tokens).• Harder to debug role errors because everything happens at once.

⸻
**## 
**
**2 | “Prompt‑Generator” Two‑Step Test (Bootstrap Pattern)**

**Step**	**What happens**

**1. Preparation run**	You ask o3‑pro: “Generate a reusable ‘Working Prompt’ that sets up the 10‑person team, embeds the two JSON schemas, and leaves placeholders for me to fill later.”↳ *Output*: a tidy prompt ~2 k tokens long.
**2. Execution run**	You copy that Working Prompt, insert your {{TOPIC}} + {{SLIDE_COUNT}}, and run it in a new chat.↳ *Output*: JSON_A + JSON_B.

**Why this is powerful**
	•	You pay the large setup cost **once**, then reuse the Working Prompt forever.
	•	If the JSON schema changes, you regenerate the Working Prompt in step 1.

**Pros**	**Cons**

• Cleaner separation of *meta‑prompt* vs *task‑prompt*.• Reusable across different chats and even other LLMs.	• Two copy/paste actions per fresh topic.• Still a monolithic reasoning process once inside step 2.

⸻
**## 
**
**3 | Incremental “Role‑Play Chain” Test (Emulated Multi‑Agent)**
**
**
**## This simulates the real McKinsey workflow inside a single chat thread by ***## time‑slicing***##  ChatGPT:**
	1.	**Prompt #1 – Partner framing**

“Act as the Managing Partner. Here is the topic and slide constraint. Produce the issue tree and assign workstreams to 2 Sr. Analysts and 5 Analysts. Output in JSON partner_plan.”
	2.	**Prompt #2 – Manager orchestration**

Feed partner_plan back in: “Act as the Engagement Manager. Write a bullet storyline and allocate slide numbers to each module. Output JSON manager_outline.”
	3.	**Prompt #3 – Analyst work modules**

Loop or batch‑ask: “Act as Analyst #n. Using manager_outline, produce your module content in intermediate JSON.”
	4.	**Prompt #4 – Final composer role**

“As Presentation Specialist, merge all modules into **JSON_A (slides)** and **JSON_B (exec summary)** conforming to schemas.”

**Pros**	**Cons**

• Mirrors real team hand‑offs—great proof of concept.• Easier to inspect/debug each stage.• Lets you test whether decomposition improves quality.	• More manual messages (4–7 per run).• Copy/paste intermediate JSON each step (unless you keep the chat thread alive).• Slightly higher total token cost.

⸻
**## 
**
**Choosing Among the Three**

**If you care most about…**	**Choose**

**Speed of first result**	**Option 1**

**Reusability of the long role prompt**	**Option 2**

**True “team feel” & diagnostic visibility**	**Option 3**

*(You can always start with Option 1, then graduate to Option 3 once the JSON schemas stabilize.)***
**

⸻
**## 
**
**Minimal Slide‑Building Setup with Claude Code + Cursor**
**
**
**## Regardless of which prompting path you pick, use the same local workflow to turn JSON → .pptx/.docx:**
	1.	**Create two files** in Cursor (slides.json, summary.json) by pasting ChatGPT outputs.
	2.	**Python script (build_deck.py)**

**## import json, sys**
**## from pptx import Presentation**
**## from pptx.util import Pt**
**## from docx import Document**
**## 
**
**## with open('slides.json') as f: deck = json.load(f)**
**## prs = Presentation()**
**for s in deck['slides']:**
**    slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[1])**
**    slide.shapes.title.text = s['title']**
**    for i, b in enumerate(s['bullets']):**
**        p = slide.shapes.placeholders[1].text_frame.add_paragraph() if i else slide.shapes.placeholders[1].text_frame.paragraphs[0]**
**        p.text = b**
**        p.font.size = Pt(18)**
**## prs.save('output.pptx')**
**## 
**
**## doc = Document()**
**with open('summary.json') as f: summ = json.load(f)**
**doc.add_heading(deck['title'], level=1)**
**## doc.add_paragraph(summ['exec_summary'])**
**doc.save('output.docx')**

**## 
**
	3.	**Run in Cursor terminal**

**python build_deck.py**

**## 
**
**## 
**
*## (python‑pptx and python‑docx install with pip install python-pptx python-docx.)***## 
**

⸻
**## 
**
**Lightweight Web‑App Variants (when you’re ready)**

**Option**	**Stack**	**Effort**	**Note**

**A. Local‑only CLI**	The script above	½ day	Cheapest; no UI.
**B. Flask micro‑service + Tailwind static front**	Flask API (/upload-json → returns file) + HTML/Alpine.js	1‑2 days	Host on Fly.io free tier; keep build logic server‑side.
**C. GitHub Codespaces + Streamlit**	Streamlit app in one Python file	1 day	Auto‑deploy; built‑in file download button.

**## Once you confirm the JSON contract works, you can replace the manual paste‑steps with an API call to o3‑pro and wire the whole thing together.**

⸻
**## 
**
**Final Advice**
	•	**Lock your JSON schemas first**—the rest is plumbing.
	•	Start with **Option 2 (Prompt‑Generator)**: it balances reuse and simplicity, and you can morph it into Option 3 later for deeper experiments.
	•	Keep every intermediate artifact (issue tree, outline) in plain JSON—makes automated regression tests trivial.

Good luck building your “consulting squad in a box”!
