# 1. Idea

1. Idea
Version 1

Helping you to stay on top of relationships that matter to you

Through call reminders, email notes, texts, social networks 

Build "double bonds" with people 

Strong Bonds with people take energy and consistency

You can only do this with a limited number of people 

Version 2
TrustMe - business app
- Gift reminders - send an automated reminder to your assistant 2 weeks before someone's occasion 

Ability to slowly ramp up communications based on how lost of a friend they are - you don't want to out-of-the-blue start calling someone, everyday, that you haven't spoken with in years

Photos of family and friends in personal app, not professional app - there will be a place for photos in "additional notes" but not front and center like in the personal app

Take small notes after the call... Follow-up 

Gamercenter integration for dashboard data sharing
The more you use the app... The more features you unlock for free... Otherwise the add-ons can be purchased for 99c or free with ads (only if you sign up for gamecenter)

To do list add-on
Calendar add-on
Collaboration/delegation add-on
Non-human relationship add-on

This is like the weekly review - automated with questions to force you to process things

Non-human relationships - connections with things you need maintain because if you ignore, they die.  Stocks, credit cards, plants, washroom, bed sheets, pillow sheets, photos on the wall, dirty laundry, email inbox, shoe polishing, dry cleaning, oil change, doctor visit, dentist visit, optometrist visit, grocery basics (milk, bread, eggs, cheese, juice, pantry etc.), batteries, hand soap, dish soap, dishwasher detergent, PVR watch list, Lysol wipes, candles, matches, paper towel, spice expiry, fridge clean out of expired goods, vaccine boosters, vacuum, dust, snail-mail checking, plant watering,
