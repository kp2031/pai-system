# Idea: take a power of my presentation that has slides paste it in…

# Idea: take a power of my presentation that has slides paste it in from different different people with different formatting and vehicle to harmonize the formatting so it looks like it was assembled by one person

This includes:
* Having one master PowerPoint template. 
* The titles are being in the same location with the same size.
* The margins are being respected across all of the slides.
* The footers are in the exact same place across all of the slides.
* The font is being the same in the body across all of the slides if possible, same font and size.
* The same “top row” colors are being used across all of the slides from the master.
