# Idea: review / comparison videos about every AI technology that I…

# Idea: review / comparison videos about every AI technology that I need in my system independently 
# 

# e.g. 
- listening to you
- speaking to you
- watching you
- understanding what it sees 
- comparing what you said with what you intended to say (speech practice) 
- comparing what is on your slide with what you said 
- understanding the body of the slide to come up with a title for the slide (image understanding into data + data interpretation)
