# Idea: App description 

I’m new to creating web apps and native iOS and android apps, and want to make the most of the new ai coding / vibe coding tools. I’d love your advice on if I’m overdoing it with my subscriptions, for what I need. 

I’d like to create a website for paying customers to create accounts and manage their profiles and subscriptions. 

I’d like to build a web interface as well as native apps for mobile devices phone and tablet as well as desktop native apps for Mac. 

The core apps I want to build is for my customers to upload slides from PowerPoint or keynote or Google slides and for the tool to help format the slides and make the copy more professional and add graphs and charts where useful. 

So i want to understand if I’m paying for the right tools for the job ahead of me. I’m currently paying for a teams membership to ChatGPT which unlocks codex, I’m paying for Lovable ai’s pro plan, and that’s it. I use github to upload code. Claude to rice next tow, But wondering what I should be paying for. What’s out there there better for what I want to do?
