# Idea: Raised Right

For folks that had parents that didnâ€™t teach them the tiny details of life, how things could be done to reduce stress and increase joy 

E.g. 
- What order do I get ready in the morning 
- Do I shower at night or in the morning?
- Do I put my shirt in first and then my underwear?
- Do I shave before or after I shower?
