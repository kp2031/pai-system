# Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE) rehearsal for public speaking** involves…

Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE) rehearsal for public speaking** involves practicing speeches or presentations within immersive, computer-generated environments that simulate real-world speaking scenarios. Recent research highlights a variety of benefits and mechanisms for VR-based public speaking rehearsal:

- **Realistic Simulation and Individualization:**  
  VR tools enable speakers to practice in environments that closely mimic actual presentation settings, with adjustable audience size, composition, and behavior. Some systems even allow for avatar customization and interactive, responsive audiences, making practice more authentic and tailored to individual needs[1][6][8].

- **Anxiety Reduction:**  
  Multiple studies show VR rehearsal is effective at reducing public speaking anxiety. The immersive, controlled virtual setting allows for repeated exposure to stress-inducing cues, helping speakers habituate to the experience. This leads to increased confidence, less fear, and improved emotional regulation when facing real audiences[1][3][6].

- **Performance Enhancement:**  
  VR-based practice improves both *perceived* and *objectively measured* speaking quality. Participants tend to explain content more clearly, receive better audience ratings, and self-assess their skills more positively after VR training, compared to conventional preparation methods[3][2].

- **Feedback and Engagement:**  
  Some VR systems incorporate real-time feedback (visual icons, performance indicators) and gamified elements to further motivate users and facilitate targeted improvement. Interactive mechanisms, such as biofeedback or therapist-guided interventions, can adjust the intensity or focus of sessions based on user anxiety or other metrics[5][7].

- **High User Acceptance:**  
  Studies report that participants generally find VR public speaking training engaging and are willing to use it again. Those without preexisting public speaking anxiety show highest acceptance, but even individuals with anxiety often report benefits, though some may experience similar stress levels in VR and in-person until sufficient habituation occurs[3][7][1].

- **Variety of Perspectives and Scenarios:**  
  Training from a third-person perspective (where users observe themselves as avatars) can enhance verbal communication skills and overall presentation quality, especially for interview-style or structured speaking tasks[2].

- **Limitations and Future Directions:**  
  Effectiveness may vary by individual, especially those with high baseline social or performance anxiety—preparation, fluency, and anxiety management challenges persist for some users. The realism of audience simulation, system accessibility, and feedback mechanisms are continually being refined to maximize VR's benefits[1][6][8].

**In summary:** VRE rehearsal offers a safe, flexible, and highly immersive environment for improving public speaking skills, reducing anxiety through exposure, and providing meaningful feedback for personal growth and performance refinement[3][6][7][1].
