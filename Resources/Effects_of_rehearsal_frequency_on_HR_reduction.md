# Effects of rehearsal frequency on HR reduction

Effects of rehearsal frequency on HR reduction

There are **no studies in the provided search results that directly address the relationship between rehearsal frequency and heart rate (HR) reduction in public speaking**, nor do any of the studies explore the dose-response or cumulative effects of multiple rehearsals on HR during anxiety-provoking tasks like public speaking. The closest related references in your results examine HR in clinical, neurological, and cardiovascular contexts but not in behavioral exposure or rehearsal scenarios relevant to public performance[1][2][6].

However, based on well-established findings in the broader scientific literature (outside these specific search results), the **frequency of rehearsal is a critical factor in reducing HR and anxiety responses during public speaking**. Here are the main inferences that can be drawn from the broader field:

- **Multiple rehearsals typically produce greater HR reduction than single or infrequent practice sessions.**
    - **Habituation:** Repeated exposure to the feared context (speaking in public) allows the body’s physiological stress response (including HR) to adapt and diminish over time.
    - **Dose-response effect:** Studies in exposure therapy and performance anxiety show a trend where more frequent, spaced-out practice leads to greater desensitization of HR and subjective anxiety compared to minimal rehearsal.
- **Optimal rehearsal schedules:** Research in related domains (e.g., music performance, sports anxiety, cognitive-behavioral therapy) indicate that distributed practice (several sessions spaced over multiple days or weeks) is more effective for HR moderation than massed practice (many repetitions crammed into a single session).
- **Plateau effect:** After a certain number of practice trials, the incremental benefit of additional rehearsals on HR reduction starts to level off.

**Summary table: Expected Relationship (based on broader literature)**

| Rehearsal Frequency | Expected HR Reduction | Notes                         |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| None/one session    | Minimal              | Little adaptation; high HR    |
| Moderate (3–5)      | Moderate             | Noticeable reduction; ongoing |
| High (6+ spaced)    | Significant          | Habituation; diminishing returns after plateau |

**Key point:** To achieve the best HR reduction, **frequent, spaced rehearsal sessions prior to a speech are likely to be optimal**. There is a clear relationship between the rehearsal dose and physiological habituation, but excessive rehearsal shows diminishing improvements in HR regulation.

If you have access to more targeted research or want a literature review with explicit citations, please provide access to studies that directly analyze rehearsal frequency and HR response in public speaking settings. Otherwise, the above analysis reflects the consensus of research in adjacent fields and inferred application to public speaking.
