# Prompt to generate a prompt 

I’d like a great specific and detailed prompt that will ultimately help me create a step by step guide to build an iOS app called RehearSmart. 

I have the domain www.rehearsmart.com if it is needed when creating the app in Xcode

Not sure it matters, but the company name I use is Be Better Offline and I have that domain as well www.bebetteroffline.com and the main email I have is hello@bebetteroffline.com 

I am very new to programming so please take time to explain things to me so I learn as I go. I’m very invested in learning how to do this and why so I can build many apps in the future.

You decide, but I was thinking to start in xcode for an ios app that will record audio of someone giving a speech and then transcribe it, and then compare side by side to the text of the speech to show where the person went off script. The app will have to use the phone’s microphone. 

I want to make sure I’m using GitHub the right way, please breakdown step by step when and where I should be going to GitHub to create a repo etc. I don’t know anything about using GitHub, other than that I’ve created an account. Please use best practices and explain to me what you’re doing so I can learn how to best use GitHub in the future. My GitHub is **kp2031 ** 

But then I’d like to use Claude code inside of my cursor ide since I have a claude max plan. So use the opus 4 model to work on the project. 

please share detailed prompts that i can input sequentially to conduct a detailed plan using claude code’s planning feature. 

then very detailed prompts to code the application. 

I also have a style guide for the app design that is in json format that i can input at some point into claude code at the right time.

Can you build it in a way that is in small chunks 

Can you please ultrathink and create the prompt that I can put into Opus 4 to walk me through this whole process step by step, and the output contains very specific and detailed steps and prompts that I can copy and paste in sequence to build my app? 

I need a series of prompts to 
I have to create a simple website that explains the app as well. this site can also facilitate the account creation, likely a freemium model, with a free option that is for the first 5 rehearsals and then to unlock a "complete" plan for 99c monthly or $9.99 annual for 100 rehearsals per month. Lovable is great at creating account authorization, sign-up via Supabase (which i have an account for). 

As well as stripe integration for collecing payments (i don't have this but i'm ok to create this if you can share step by step guide). Can you share a series of prompts that i can input sequentially into lovable to create a website where customer learn about the product and create an account and sign up to either a free or paid plan.
