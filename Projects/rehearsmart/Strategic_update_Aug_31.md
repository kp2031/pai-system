# Strategic update Aug 31

**# 5-Minute Team Meeting: Annual Planning Business Update**
**Meeting Duration:** 5 minutes**Topic:** FY2025 Annual Planning - Pain Points, Opportunities & Prioritization**Action Required:** 5-page white paper due September 10

**## Opening (30 seconds)**
Good morning, team. Today we're kicking off our annual planning process for fiscal 2025. I need everyone to understand where we're experiencing friction, what our customers are telling us, and where the biggest opportunities lie. By September 10th, I need each functional lead to contribute to a 5-page white paper that will guide our resource allocation for next year.
**## Part 1: Internal Business Pain Points (1 minute)**
Let me start with what's holding us back operationally:
**Tech Infrastructure Challenges:**

* Our cloud processing costs are eating 40% of our monthly burn - we're spending $2,800/month on GPU instances for video analysis when we only have 500 MAU
* API dependencies are killing us - Google Speech-to-Text pricing increased 30% last quarter, adding $450/month we didn't budget for
* Mobile app performance is inconsistent - Android users experience 3x longer processing times than iOS, causing 25% higher churn on that platform
* We can't scale coaching efficiently - each coach can only handle 12 clients effectively, creating a $1,200 CAC when factoring in recruitment and training

**Data & Analytics Gaps:**

* We're flying blind on user improvement metrics - only 15% of users complete pre/post assessments
* No clear correlation data between feature usage and actual performance improvement
* Can't segment properly - we think enterprise users have 3x higher LTV but our attribution is broken

**## Part 2: Customer Pain Points (1 minute)**
From our last 50 customer interviews and support tickets:
**Top Customer Frustrations:**

* **Latency kills practice flow** - 78% of users say waiting 2-3 minutes for analysis breaks their momentum
* **Generic feedback feels useless** - "Your pace was 165 WPM" means nothing without context for their specific industry/audience
* **Privacy concerns** - 4 enterprise deals ($180K combined) stalled because we can't guarantee on-device processing
* **Integration friction** - Users want this in their existing tools (Zoom, Teams, PowerPoint) not another standalone app
* **Price-to-value mismatch** - At $20/month, users expect human-level insights but get "you said 'um' 12 times"

**## Part 3: Market Opportunities Analysis (1.5 minutes)**
Here's where we can win:
**Competitive Gaps We Can Exploit:**

|  **Opportunity**<br/> | **Market Size**<br/> | **Competitor Weakness**<br/> | **Our Potential Edge**<br/> | **Revenue Impact**<br/> |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|  **Real-time in-meeting coaching**<br/> | $2.8B TAM<br/> | Yoodli/Orai are post-session only<br/> | Live subtle cues during Zoom<br/> | $8-12M ARR by Y3<br/> |
|  **Team/Enterprise Analytics**<br/> | $850M TAM<br/> | Poised is individual-only<br/> | Aggregate team dashboards<br/> | $4-6M ARR by Y2<br/> |
|  **Physiological + Performance**<br/> | $450M niche<br/> | Nobody combines biometrics + speech<br/> | Anxiety correlation insights<br/> | $2-3M ARR specialty<br/> |
|  **Industry-specific models**<br/> | $1.2B across verticals<br/> | Generic "good speaking" rules<br/> | Sales vs. Teaching vs. Legal AI<br/> | $15M ARR at scale<br/> |
|  **White-label platform**<br/> | $600M B2B2C<br/> | Competitors go direct only<br/> | Power other coaches/platforms<br/> | $5M ARR recurring<br/> |

**Quick Competitive Intelligence:**

* Yoodli just raised $15M Series A - they're going enterprise hard
* Poised is stuck at 10K users after 2 years - their Zoom-only strategy is limiting
* Orai's mobile-first approach has 50K downloads but <5% convert to paid
* Traditional coaches charge $200/hour but can't scale - perfect for hybrid model

**## Part 4: Financial Prioritization Framework (1 minute)**
We need to stack rank every initiative by these metrics:
**ROI Calculation Formula:**

`Expected Value = (``Revenue`` Potential × Win Probability × Margin %) - (Dev Cost + Ongoing OpEx)`
`                 ÷ Time to Revenue (months)`
**Current Stack Ranking (preliminary):**

1. **On-device processing** - $4.2M value
	* Saves $30K/month in cloud costs
	* Unlocks 12 enterprise deals in pipeline
	* 4-month dev effort = $850K/month return
2. **Zoom/Teams integration** - $3.8M value
	* 60% of prospects ask for this
	* $45 CAC vs $180 current
	* 6-week sprint = massive distribution
3. **Industry-specific AI models** - $2.9M value
	* 3x higher pricing tolerance ($60/mo)
	* Sales teams alone = 50K potential users
	* 3-month development per vertical
4. **Real-time coaching overlay** - $2.1M value
	* Breakthrough differentiator
	* Patent-pending opportunity
	* 6-month complex build but defensible

**## Part 5: Action Items & White Paper Requirements (30 seconds)**
**Your assignment - Due September 10:**

Each functional lead must contribute 1 page to our 5-page white paper:
* **Page 1 (Product/Tech):** Technical feasibility assessment of top 4 opportunities
* **Page 2 (Sales/Marketing):** TAM validation and customer willingness-to-pay data
* **Page 3 (Operations):** Resource requirements and hiring plan for each initiative
* **Page 4 (Finance):** Detailed financial models with sensitivity analysis
* **Page 5 (Executive Summary):** Recommended sequencing and Go/No-Go decisions

**White paper must include:**

* Quantified business cases with 3-year projections
* Competitive response scenarios
* Risk matrices with mitigation plans
* Clear success metrics and checkpoints
* Resource allocation recommendations

**## Closing (30 seconds)**
This is our moment to be surgical about resource allocation. We can't be everything to everyone - we need to pick the battles where we have unfair advantages. Every idea needs a number attached. Every project needs a clear ROI.
I want brutal honesty about what we can actually deliver with our current team of 8 and $180K monthly burn. Better to nail 2 game-changing features than half-deliver 5.
Questions? Great. Slack me 1-on-1. White papers due September 10, 9am sharp. Let's build something remarkable.
**Remember:** We're not just building features - we're building the future of human performance improvement. Make every decision count.
