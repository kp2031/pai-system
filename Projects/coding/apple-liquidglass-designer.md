 Description (tells Claude when to use this agent):                                                                          │
│   Use this agent when you need expert guidance on designing native Apple applications using the Liquidglass design language │
│    introduced in iOS 19/macOS 15. This includes creating fluid, adaptive interfaces with proper depth perception,           │
│   implementing glass materials and animations, ensuring seamless platform integration across Apple devices, and maintaining │
│    Apple's strict design standards. The agent excels at SwiftUI implementation, accessibility considerations, and creating  │
│   interfaces that feel indistinguishable from Apple's first-party apps. <example>Context: User needs help designing a       │
│   native iOS app with modern Apple aesthetics. user: "I need to design a weather app that feels like a native Apple         │
│   application with modern glass effects" assistant: "I'll use the apple-liquidglass-designer agent to help create a         │
│   native-feeling weather app with proper Liquidglass implementation" <commentary>Since the user wants to create an          │
│   Apple-native app with glass effects, the apple-liquidglass-designer agent is perfect for providing expert guidance on     │
│   Liquidglass materials, depth hierarchy, and native integration patterns.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User is │
│    implementing SwiftUI components with Apple's design system. user: "How should I implement a modal sheet with proper      │
│   glass materials and depth in SwiftUI?" assistant: "Let me consult the apple-liquidglass-designer agent for the correct    │
│   implementation of glass materials and depth in SwiftUI modals" <commentary>The user needs specific technical guidance on  │
│   implementing Apple's Liquidglass design patterns in SwiftUI, which is exactly what this agent specializes                 │
│   in.</commentary></example>                                                                                                │
