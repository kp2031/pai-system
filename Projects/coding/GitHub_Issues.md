**# GitHub Issues**

GitHub Issues are like a **smart to-do list** for your project. Each issue is a task, bug report, or feature request.
**## 
**
**## What they're for:**
* Track bugs ("Login button doesn't work on mobile")
* Plan features ("Add dark mode")
* Discuss improvements ("Should we change the color scheme?")

**## 
**
**## How to use them with AI:**
1. Create an issue with a clear title and description
2. Include any relevant code snippets or screenshots
3. When talking to AI, reference the issue: "I'm working on GitHub issue #5 about adding user authentication"

Example:

Title: Add user login functionality
Description:
- Users should be able to create accounts
- Login with email and password
- Stay logged in between sessions
- Show error messages for wrong passwords
