# Commit messages best practices 

**Format to follow:**

* Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
* Keep it under 50 characters
* Be specific about what changed
* If needed, add a blank line and then more details

# Good examples:
"Add user login functionality"
"Fix bug where button didn't respond to clicks"
"Update navbar styling for mobile devices"

# Bad examples:
"fixed stuff"
"update"
"asdfasdf"
