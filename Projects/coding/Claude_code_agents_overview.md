# Claude code agents overview

I’ll create detailed prompts for each Claude Code agent following best practices. These prompts are designed to be copied directly into Claude Code CLI for optimal agent performance.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I’ve created a comprehensive collection of detailed prompts for each Claude Code agent you requested. Each prompt follows best practices for Claude Code and is structured to:

1. **Clearly define the agent’s role and expertise**
1. **List specific responsibilities and capabilities**
1. **Provide a structured approach to tasks**
1. **Include technical implementation details**
1. **Define clear deliverables**
1. **Emphasize best practices for each domain**

The prompts are formatted so you can:

- Copy them directly into Claude Code CLI
- Save them as text files for reuse
- Modify them based on your specific requirements

Each agent prompt includes:

- **Core responsibilities** that define what the agent should focus on
- **Implementation approaches** that guide how tasks should be completed
- **Technical standards** specific to that domain
- **Deliverables** that specify what should be produced
- **Best practices** relevant to that specialization

These prompts will help Claude Code create specialized agents that can handle complex tasks in their respective domains while maintaining high code quality, proper documentation, and comprehensive testing.

I’ll thoroughly analyze the current agents and identify critical gaps for building a >$1M ARR business. Let me think through all aspects of a scalable, secure, and profitable operation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I’ve thoroughly analyzed the requirements for building a >$1M ARR business and added **10 additional critical agents** that are often the difference between a struggling startup and a successful, scalable enterprise. Here’s what I added and why:

## **The Missing Pieces for $1M+ ARR Success:**

### 🏦 **Financial & Legal Infrastructure**

- **Financial Controller Agent** - You NEED proper financial reporting, revenue recognition, and investor-grade metrics. This is non-negotiable for raising funds or selling the company.
- **Legal & Compliance Automation Agent** - Automates contracts, compliance tracking, and reduces legal costs that can eat into margins.

### 💼 **Revenue Acceleration Systems**

- **Enterprise Sales Tools Agent** - To reach $1M ARR, you’ll need to land enterprise deals. This agent builds the tools to manage complex sales cycles.
- **Partnership & Integration Platform Agent** - Creates network effects and ecosystem growth through partnerships and integrations.

### 📊 **Intelligence & Decision Systems**

- **Data Analytics & BI Agent** - You can’t manage what you don’t measure. Comprehensive analytics for data-driven decisions.
- **Executive Dashboard & Reporting Agent** - Board-ready reporting and real-time KPI visibility for strategic alignment.

### 👥 **Human & Quality Systems**

- **QA & Testing Automation Agent** - Quality issues kill SaaS businesses. Comprehensive testing prevents costly bugs.
- **Talent & HR Systems Agent** - Your team is everything. Proper HR systems for hiring and retaining top talent.

### 🛡️ **Protection & Risk Management**

- **Intellectual Property Management Agent** - Protect your competitive advantages and prevent costly IP disputes.
- **Risk Management & Insurance Agent** - Identify and mitigate risks before they become company-ending crises.

## **Why These Agents Are Critical:**

1. **Investor Readiness**: VCs will scrutinize your financials, legal structure, and risk management. These agents ensure you’re fundable.
1. **Enterprise Sales**: Individual subscriptions at $10-30/month require 3,000+ customers for $1M ARR. With enterprise deals at $50k+/year, you need only 20 customers.
1. **Operational Excellence**: As you scale, manual processes break. These agents automate critical business functions.
1. **Competitive Moat**: IP protection, partnership ecosystems, and data intelligence create defensible advantages.
1. **Risk Mitigation**: One lawsuit, data breach, or compliance violation can destroy an early-stage company.

## **The Path to $1M ARR:**

With these 30 agents, you have a complete blueprint for:

- **Months 0-6**: MVP launch with core product
- **Months 6-12**: Add billing, support, and initial scale

- **Months 18-24**: Full platform with all business units operational

Each agent is designed to work together, creating a comprehensive system that can:

- Handle individual users to Fortune 500 enterprises
- Scale from $0 to $10M+ ARR
- Maintain compliance and security standards
- Provide investor-grade reporting and metrics

The prompts are production-ready and include specific features for Be Better Offline’s unique needs (video analysis, biometric data, coaching platforms).

Would you like me to create additional specialized agents for specific aspects like:

These 30 agents represent a complete technical and business foundation for building a successful SaaS company.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
