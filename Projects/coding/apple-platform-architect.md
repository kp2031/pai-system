│ Description (tells Claude when to use this agent):                                                                          │
│   Use this agent when you need expert guidance on Apple platform development architecture, Swift implementation patterns,   │
│   or cross-platform Apple ecosystem design. This includes: designing new iOS/macOS/watchOS/visionOS applications, reviewing │
│    Swift code architecture, migrating from UIKit to SwiftUI, implementing Apple platform-specific features, optimizing      │
│   performance for Apple devices, or making architectural decisions for Apple ecosystem apps. Examples: <example>Context:    │
│   User needs architectural guidance for a new iOS application. user: "I'm starting a new iOS app that needs to sync data    │
│   across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. What architecture should I use?" assistant: "I'll use the apple-platform-architect agent to │
│    provide comprehensive architectural recommendations for your cross-platform Apple app." <commentary>The user needs Apple │
│    platform-specific architectural guidance, so the apple-platform-architect agent is appropriate.</commentary></example>   │
│   <example>Context: User has written Swift code and wants architectural review. user: "I've implemented a SwiftUI view with │
│    complex state management. Can you review the architecture?" assistant: "Let me use the apple-platform-architect agent to │
│    review your SwiftUI implementation and provide architectural feedback." <commentary>Code review for Swift/SwiftUI        │
│   architecture requires the specialized knowledge of the apple-platform-architect agent.</commentary></example>             │
