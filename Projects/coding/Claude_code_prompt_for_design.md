# Claude code prompt for design

Gitingest
To take repositories and create LLM friendly versions to paste into AIs

Mega prompt provided so you only have to share the idea and the agents file - and it will generate the entire workflow

Paste the agents into Claude and ask if to create a workflow that links the agents to each other

Prompt:

I need to make a coding workflow from this. stricity coding
i would like to make next js apps from this i would like
ux then ui then full front-end and then backend and thats it for now but i want it from these agents
and these agents are going to need connection between them so i want you to make me connections or workflows between them
and this is how the workflows are made
> First use the code-analyzer subagent to find performance issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
this is using multiple subagents togethter i want this kind of workflow
where i can start with a prd or an idea, and then based on that i continue

Next prompt

I needed to ask
where would they save this stuff??

Start with PRD that outlines the idea, purpose, goals, strategy etc.
Then
use the ux-researcher to map user flows and define core features, then use the sprint-prioritizer to create MVP scope and technical requirements
Then
Use the ux-researcher to create wireframes and interaction patterns, then use the sprint-prioritizer to break down into buildable components

And now in order to initialize everything use this prompt to generate all of them arms needed for each phaseâ€¦

okay so i have to tell them this?
give me prompts for all the phases and then tell me how to use them with the file structure
