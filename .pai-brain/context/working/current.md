## Active Work
- Testing weekly processing workflow
- Validating ULTRATHINK functionality
- Confirming cross-domain search

## Architecture Decisions
- Single vault for cross-domain discovery
- Dot-folders for AI/human separation
- Symlinks for backward compatibility
- Everything searchable, logically separated

## Key Insights
- The filesystem IS the context system
- Obsidian as component, not hub
- AI brain separate but accessible
- Cross-domain patterns emerge from unity

## Next Actions
- [ ] Test weekly processing pipeline
- [ ] Validate ULTRATHINK mode
- [ ] Confirm search across all domains
- [ ] Create final GitHub backup
