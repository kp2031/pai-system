## Session Summary
**Morning Session (5:38 AM - 7:00 AM EST)**
**Evening Session (11:30 PM - 12:00 AM EST)**

### Major Accomplishments

1. **âœ… Complete PAI Migration to Single-Vault Architecture**
   - Moved from Obsidian-as-hub to Obsidian-as-component
   - Created .pai-brain, .pai-processing, .pai-analytics structures
   - Setup ~/.claude symlinks
   - Tested and validated all systems
   - 3,843 searchable files in single vault

2. **âœ… GTD + Things 3 Integration Planning**
   - Analyzed Things 3 setup with 36 inbox items
   - Mapped Things areas to PAI domains
   - Designed daily capture workflow
   - Created cognitive task management architecture
   - Plan saved to: `.pai-brain/context/projects/gtd-integration/PLAN.md`

3. **âœ… Apple Notes Export Strategy**
   - Decided on Exporter app (proven in 14-year migration)
   - Daily export to `.pai-processing/staging/daily/`
   - Metadata preservation prioritized
   - Claude handles all processing commands

4. **âœ… Things 3 â†’ Cognitive Operations Migration** (Evening)
   - Extracted complete Things 3 database (4,736 tasks, 75 projects)
   - Built Cognitive Operations system replacing GTD
   - Created research/pre-work/synthesis queues
   - Started pre-work on audio equipment research
   - Transformed tasks into knowledge-generating operations

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Single Vault Architecture**: Everything in one Obsidian vault for cross-domain discovery
2. **Dot-folder Separation**: .pai-* folders for AI operations
3. **Daily Processing**: Moving from weekly to daily note processing
4. **GTD Bridge**: Tasks generate knowledge, knowledge informs tasks
5. **Claude as Processor**: User doesn't run commands, Claude handles everything

### Files Created/Modified

**Architecture Files**:
- `/Users/kavi/Obsidian/.pai-brain/context/MASTER.md` - Master context
- `/Users/kavi/Obsidian/.pai-brain/context/domains/family.md` - Family domain
- `/Users/kavi/Obsidian/.pai-brain/context/domains/ideas.md` - Ideas domain
- `/Users/kavi/Obsidian/.pai-brain/context/projects/betteroffline/CONTEXT.md`

**Planning Documents**:
- `/Users/kavi/Obsidian/PAI-MIGRATION-SUCCESS.md` - Migration summary
- `/Users/kavi/Obsidian/.pai-brain/context/projects/gtd-integration/PLAN.md` - GTD integration

**Scripts Ready**:
- `pai-process-weekly.js` - Weekly processing
- `pai-ultrathink.js` - Deep analysis (fixed and tested)
- All scripts in `.pai-brain/commands/`

### Current State

- PAI System: **FULLY OPERATIONAL** âœ…
- Single Vault: **ACTIVE** with 3,843 files
- Symlinks: **~/.claude â†’ .pai-brain** working
- Daily Processing: **READY** (awaiting first export)
- GTD Integration: **COMPLETED** âœ…
- Cognitive Operations: **LIVE** with Things 3 fully migrated

### Next Actions After Reboot

1. **Export Apple Notes** using Exporter to `.pai-processing/staging/daily/`
2. **Tell Claude**: "Process today's notes"
3. **Start GTD capture** in Apple Notes with format:
   - `task: [description] #area:[area] #priority:[level]`
   - `done: [task] - [insight]`
   - `project: [name] #area:[area]`

### Key Insights from Session

1. **Filesystem IS the context system** - Everything organized for AI consumption
2. **Single vault enables cross-domain discovery** - Patterns emerge from unity
3. **User doesn't need terminal** - Claude runs all commands
4. **Daily > Weekly** for maintaining context freshness
5. **Tasks + Knowledge = Cognitive Task Management**

## To Continue After Reboot

Just say: "I'm back, let's continue where we left off"

Claude will:
1. Load this context
2. Be ready to process your Apple Notes exports
3. Implement GTD integration
4. Run any commands you need

**All plans and architecture are saved and ready!**
