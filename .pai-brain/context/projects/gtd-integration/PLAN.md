## 🚀 Integration Vision: "Cognitive Task Management"

### Core Architecture
```
Things 3 (Action) ←→ Daily Note (Bridge) ←→ PAI (Knowledge)
```

**Key Principle**: Tasks generate knowledge, knowledge informs tasks

---

## 📱 Recommended Workflow: "The Daily Sync"

### Morning Ritual (2 minutes)
1. Open Things 3 → Today view
2. Open Daily Note in Obsidian
3. Copy today's tasks as markdown checklist
4. Add context/thoughts for each

### Throughout Day (Continuous Capture)
**In Apple Notes**:
```
"task: Call accountant about Q3 #area:Finance #urgent"
"project: Plan Niam's birthday party #area:Family"
"done: Finished presentation - went better than expected"
"idea: What if task completion patterns predict energy levels?"
```

### Evening Processing (5 minutes)
**You**: "Claude, process today's captures"
**Claude**:
- Parses tasks/projects/insights
- Updates task tracking in PAI
- Creates/updates project documents
- Surfaces patterns in productivity
- Prepares tomorrow's view
