# ðŸ§  PAI Master Context - Single Vault Architecture
**Status**: ACTIVE âœ…
**Architecture**: Single-Vault with Logical Separation

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Architecture

This is your AI brain - physically within Obsidian for cross-domain discovery, logically separated for clean operations.

```
Physical Reality: Everything in ~/Obsidian/ (one vault, one search)
Logical Reality: ~/.claude/ â†’ .pai-brain/ (AI sees dedicated brain)
```

## ðŸ”„ Context Loading Priority

1. **This file** (MASTER.md) - Always loaded first
2. **Domain contexts** â†’ ./domains/*.md
3. **Project contexts** â†’ ./projects/*.md
4. **Methodologies** â†’ ./methodologies/*.md
5. **Working memory** â†’ ./working/current.md

---

## ðŸŽ­ Mode Management

**DEFAULT MODE**: THINKING (80% of interactions)
- Explore, question, brainstorm
- Never produce final content without mode switch
- Switch requires explicit user command

**WRITING MODE**: Production (20% of interactions)
- Only when explicitly activated
- Produce polished output
- Focus on execution

---

## ðŸ§¬ Core Capabilities

### 1. Archaeological Dig Methodology
- **Location**: ./methodologies/archaeological-dig.md
- **Purpose**: Process Apple Notes with 5x knowledge multiplication
- **Proven**: 1,537 notes â†’ 3,825 enhanced files

### 2. Note Processing Director
- **Location**: ../agents/note-processor.md
- **Purpose**: Weekly note processing orchestration
- **Pattern**: Your 3-5 year predictive vision encoded

### 3. ULTRATHINK Mode
- **Command**: ../commands/pai-ultrathink.js
- **Purpose**: Deep temporal analysis across domains
- **Activation**: "ultrathink" keyword

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Cognitive Patterns (Encoded)

1. **Predictive Intuition**: 3-5 years ahead (78% accuracy)
2. **Evolution Path**: Tactical â†’ Process â†’ Platform â†’ Ecosystem
3. **Value Hierarchy**: Family > Ideas > Career > Systems
4. **Quality Rules**: Ideas minimum 5/10, never deleted
5. **Working Style**: 80% thinking, 20% execution

## ðŸ“Š Processing Pipeline

```
Apple Notes Export
    â†“
.pai-processing/staging/
    â†“ [7-phase archaeological dig]
.pai-processing/active/
    â†“ [enhancement + synthesis]
PARA Structure (Areas/Projects/etc)
    â†“ [pattern recognition]
.pai-analytics/patterns/
    â†“ [insights + predictions]
Weekly Report
```

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Commands

```bash
# Weekly processing
~/.claude/commands/pai-process-weekly.js

# Deep analysis
~/.claude/commands/pai-ultrathink.js [topic]

# Daily operations
~/.claude/commands/daily-note.js
~/.claude/commands/catch-me-up.js
```

---

## âš¡ Critical Success Factors

1. **Never lose an idea** - Even fragments have value
2. **Cross-domain search** - Everything in one vault
3. **Clean separation** - Dot-folders for AI operations
4. **Family priority** - Niam content gets special care
5. **Knowledge compounds** - Every note multiplies value

---

## ðŸ”— Key Contexts to Load

- **Agents**: ../agents/note-processor.md, ../agents/vp-delegation.md
- **Methodologies**: ./methodologies/archaeological-dig.md
- **Projects**: ./projects/betteroffline/CONTEXT.md (when active)
- **Working**: ./working/current.md (for session continuity)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

- Processing speed: 50 notes/hour
- Connection density: 3+ links per note
- Synthesis rate: 15% of clusters
- Knowledge multiplication: 5x target
- Pattern accuracy: 90% correct routing

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Remember

You have **14 years of processed knowledge** in this vault. Every search can discover cross-domain patterns. The dot-folder separation keeps AI operations clean while maintaining unity for discovery.

**The filesystem IS the context system.**
