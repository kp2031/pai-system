## ðŸŽ¯ Next Time You Give Me a Task

Instead of: "I need to call the bank"

Give me: "I need to call TD Bank (1-866-222-3456) about my checking account (****4567) to add Pri as authorized user"

Then I can create:
```
Call TD Bank - Add Authorized User
Phone: 1-866-222-3456
Best time: Weekday 10am-2pm (shorter wait)
Account: Checking ****4567

Script:
"Hi, I'd like to add an authorized user to my checking account ending in 4567"
They'll ask for: Pri's full name, DOB, SIN
Have ready: Your PIN, Pri's info
Expected time: 8-10 minutes
```
