## üß† ULTRATHINK: Why This Matters

You operate at 80% thinking, 20% doing. Your cognitive operations folder was forcing you into 100% doing mode with 39 "active" items. No wonder you felt stuck.

Now you have:
- **1 active project** (manageable)
- **Reference systems** (searchable when needed)
- **Action plans** (pre-thought, just execute)

This aligns with your natural mode: Think deeply, act decisively.
