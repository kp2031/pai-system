## Quick Commands

### Daily Operations
```
"Claude, what needs pre-work today?"
"Show me research opportunities"
"Generate synthesis from recent operations"
```

### Knowledge Mining
```
"Extract patterns from this week"
"What knowledge can we generate?"
"Connect these operations"
```

### Strategic Planning
```
"Predict bottlenecks"
"Suggest operation sequences"
"Optimize cognitive load"
```

## Key Principles

1. **Tasks are future knowledge** - Every operation generates insights
2. **Knowledge compounds** - Past work accelerates future work
3. **Pre-work multiplies time** - Claude advances work asynchronously
4. **Patterns predict success** - Historical data guides decisions
5. **Synthesis over storage** - Generate new knowledge, don't just track
