	- Divide papers that you want to keep into two piles - papers to be saved and papers that need to be dealt with
	- Letter is requiring a reply, forms that need to be submitted, articles I intend to read etc
	- Keep all of these papers in one spot in the home never more than one spot - use of vertical organizer so they can all be seen and are not put into a stack
	- For papers that need to be saved, sort them into two categories: infrequently used papers (Insurance policies, guarantees, leases) and more frequently used papers (outlines of seminars, newspaper clippings, etc)
	- Put all in frequently used papers into single clear plastic files into a binder 
	
	
	4.Komono / miscellaneous
	- Only keep the items that spark joy
	1. CDs/DVDs
	2. Skin care products
	3. Make up
	4. Accessories
	5. Valuables - passports and credit cards
	6. Electrical equipment and accessories
	7. Household equipment, stationary and writing material, sewing kits, etc.
	8. Household supplies - medicine, detergents, tissues etc.
	9. Kitchen goods – spatulas, pots, blenders, etc.
	10. Other – spare change, figurines, etc.
	
	Tips
	- throw away all items that you feel right away our instantly disposable
	
	Gifts/Presents
	- does this present suit my taste?
	- The true purpose of a present is to be received - presents aren't things, but a means to convey someone's feelings
	- Coins in bags - get them to the bank asap - into my wallet 
	
	5.Mementos 
	- sentimental value 
	- Ask yourself -- does it spark joy?
	
	Don't send your keepsakes to your parents place 
	- go to parents place and get rid of all my old stuff - and confront and process your past
	- The purpose of the letter is to be enjoyed when received
	
	Photos
	- Put all photos in a pile from wherever they are all over the home
	- They exist only to show a specific event or time 
	- Does it inspire joy ?
	- Usually 5 per day when traveling 
	- Don't keep photos in a stack - put them into an album
	
	A massive stockpile of a simple stuff:
	- Toothbrushes
	- Pens 
	- Markers
	- Drawing pencils
	- Notepads
