## Risk Management & Rollback Plans

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation
*Identify potential problems and solutions*

#### Technical Risks
1. **Context Loading Failures**: System fails to load required contexts
   - **Probability**: MEDIUM
   - **Impact**: HIGH
   - **Mitigation**: Implement 4-layer enforcement with validation
   - **Contingency**: Manual context loading fallback

2. **Mode Confusion**: Users accidentally write in thinking mode
   - **Probability**: LOW
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM
   - **Mitigation**: Visual indicators and enforcement hooks
   - **Contingency**: Undo functionality and clear warnings

3. **Performance Degradation**: Too many contexts slow system
   - **Probability**: MEDIUM
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM
   - **Mitigation**: Implement context caching and lazy loading
   - **Contingency**: Manual context pruning

#### Project Risks
1. **Complexity Overwhelm**: System becomes too complex to manage
   - **Probability**: MEDIUM
   - **Impact**: HIGH
   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, add features gradually
   - **Contingency**: Rollback to simpler version

2. **Adoption Friction**: Learning curve too steep
   - **Probability**: LOW
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure, good documentation
   - **Contingency**: Simplified starter mode

### Rollback Procedures
*How to recover from problems*

#### Rollback Decision Tree
```
Issue Severity Assessment:
├── Minor (UI glitch, non-critical bug)
│   └── Create hotfix branch → Fix → Test → Deploy
├── Major (Feature not working, performance issue)
│   └── Rollback to last checkpoint → Investigate → Fix → Re-deploy
└── Critical (Security breach, data loss, system down)
    └── Immediate rollback to last stable → Emergency response → Root cause analysis
```

#### Rollback Commands
```bash
# Quick rollback to last stable checkpoint
git checkout [CHECKPOINT_TAG]

# Full rollback to previous release
git checkout [PREVIOUS_RELEASE_TAG]

# Create emergency hotfix
git checkout -b hotfix/emergency-fix
```
