## Vision & Mission

### Product Vision
Build a Personal AI Infrastructure that creates a **VP of AI Agents** coordinating specialized Directors who manage domain-specific Assistants, enabling individuals to augment their capabilities across every aspect of life—from knowledge management and career growth to family relationships and personal health.

### Mission Statement
Transform individuals into augmented humans by providing them with an AI executive team that:
- Manages complexity through hierarchical delegation
- Accumulates knowledge through every interaction
- Maintains context across all life domains
- Separates thinking from writing to maximize insight generation
- Solves problems once and reuses solutions forever

### Value Proposition
Your PAI system provides:
- **10x Productivity**: Handle tasks that previously required a team of assistants
- **Perfect Memory**: Never lose context or forget important details
- **Compound Intelligence**: Every project makes the system smarter
- **Life Integration**: Seamlessly manage career, family, health, finance, and entertainment
- **Human Augmentation**: Amplify your capabilities without replacing your humanity

## Product Philosophy

### Core Beliefs
- **System Over Intelligence**: The orchestration and scaffolding are far more important than model intelligence
- **Text as Thought Primitives**: Text/Markdown is the fundamental building block of thought
- **Solve Once, Reuse Forever**: Following UNIX philosophy—every problem solved becomes a reusable module
- **Centralized Context, Not Scattered Knowledge**: Use UFC (Universal File-based Context) system
- **Thinking Before Writing**: 80% thinking mode, 20% writing mode for better outcomes
- **Conversations as Knowledge Objects**: Every AI chat becomes reusable intelligence

### Design Philosophy
The system is designed around:
- **File-system-based context management** (UFC architecture)
- **Progressive context hydration** (load only what's needed)
- **Modular tool composition** (commands, MCPs, Fabric patterns)
- **Mode separation** (explicit thinking vs writing modes)
- **Hierarchical delegation** (VP → Directors → Assistants)

### User Experience Philosophy
- **AI as thinking partner**, not just content generator
- **Read mode over write mode**—leverage AI's ability to understand your entire vault
- **Explicit mode control** prevents premature convergence
- **Daily progress continuity** ensures no loss of context
- **Vault-wide intelligence** for maximum insight generation

### Research Findings
Based on analysis of Daniel Miessler's approach and Noah Brier's workflow:

1. **Finding: AI's value is in reading, not writing**
   - Users get more value from AI understanding their knowledge base than generating content
   - Implication: Prioritize vault-wide search and context gathering

2. **Finding: Premature writing kills ideation**
   - LLMs default to writing drafts too quickly
   - Implication: Enforce thinking mode as default

3. **Finding: Context switching is expensive**
   - Losing project context when returning after breaks is costly
   - Implication: Build "catch me up" functionality

4. **Finding: Every conversation contains insights**
   - Chat transcripts are valuable knowledge artifacts
   - Implication: Archive and index all AI conversations

### Validation Methods
- **Dogfooding**: Build and use the system daily for personal work
- **Time tracking**: Measure time saved on routine tasks
- **Quality metrics**: Track insights generated vs traditional methods
- **User feedback**: Gather feedback from early adopters
- **Iteration velocity**: Measure how quickly the system improves itself

## Strategic Decisions Log

### Decision: UFC Architecture Over Distributed Configs
**Date:** 2024-11-01
**Decision:** Centralize all context under ~/.claude/context/
**Rationale:** Prevents context sprawl, enables clean project directories
**Alternatives Considered:** claude.md in every folder (too messy)
**Impact:** Cleaner projects, better context management

### Decision: Thinking Mode as Default
**Date:** 2024-11-05
**Decision:** Default to thinking mode, explicit switch to writing
**Rationale:** Prevents premature convergence, better ideation
**Alternatives Considered:** Smart mode detection (too unreliable)
**Impact:** Better insights, some initial user friction

### Decision: VP → Directors → Assistants Hierarchy
**Date:** 2024-11-10
**Decision:** Three-tier agent hierarchy for orchestration
**Rationale:** Matches organizational complexity patterns
**Alternatives Considered:** Flat agent structure (insufficient for complexity)
**Impact:** Better task delegation, clearer responsibilities

### Decision: 4-Layer Context Enforcement
**Date:** 2024-11-15
**Decision:** Multiple enforcement mechanisms for context loading
**Rationale:** Single layer insufficient for reliability
**Alternatives Considered:** Trust-based loading (too unreliable)
**Impact:** 95%+ context load success rate
