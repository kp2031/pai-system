## üí≠ Coach Claude Says:

"You've carried this for 5 years. That's approximately 1,825 days of low-level stress. Today, in less time than it takes to watch a sitcom, you can delete this burden forever.

The hardest part is picking up the phone. Once you say 'Hi, I need to update my address,' you're 90% done.

You've got this. 20 minutes to freedom. Let's do it!"
