| 3 | 4 | $5,000 | $1,000 | $2,200 |
| 4 | 5 | $2,500 | $500 | $2,700 |
| 5 | 6 | $2,500 | $500 | $3,200 |
| 6 | 7 | $2,500 | $500 | $3,700 |
| 7 | 8 | $2,500 | $500 | $4,200 |
| 8 | 9 | $2,500 | $500 | $4,700 |
| 9 | 10 | $2,500 | $500 | $5,200 |
| 10 | 11 | $2,500 | $500 | $5,700 |
| 11 | 12 | $2,500 | $500 | $6,200 |
| 12 | 13 | $2,500 | $500 | $6,700 |
| 13 | 14 | $2,500 | $500 | $7,200 |

After reaching the CESG limit in the 13th year, your friend can continue contributing to the RESP, but no additional CESG will be received.
