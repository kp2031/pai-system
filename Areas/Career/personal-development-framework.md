## Life Design Methodology (2018)

### 5 Core Mindsets for Getting Unstuck

#### 1. Curiosity Mindset
- **Approach**: "There's something interesting about everything"
- **Question**: "What do experts in this field argue about?"
- **Application**: Maintain beginner's mind, seek diverse perspectives

#### 2. Bias to Action Mindset
- **Approach**: "Try stuff"
- **Questions**: "What can I do to help answer that question? What's actionable and what will we learn?"
- **Application**: Experiment over analysis paralysis

#### 3. Reframing Mindset
- **Approach**: "Reframe problems"
- **Questions**: "What perspective do I have vs. others? How will this look in a year?"
- **Application**: Shift context to unlock new solutions

#### 4. Awareness Mindset
- **Approach**: "Know it's a process"
- **Questions**: "What are all the steps? Are you on the right step? What's the worst/best that can happen?"
- **Application**: Process thinking, risk assessment, step-by-step awareness

#### 5. Radical Collaboration Mindset
- **Approach**: "Ask for help"
- **Methods**: Help journal, mentorship, 5-minute feedback requests
- **Application**: Leverage network and community

### Compass & Practices Framework

#### The Coherence Question
**Core Alignment Check**: How in-sync are you between:
1. **Who you are?** (Identity)
2. **What you believe?** (Values)
3. **What you're doing?** (Actions)

#### Work View Development (250 words, ~30 minutes)
**Essential Questions**:
- What good work deserves to be
- Why work? What's work for? What does work mean?
- How does work relate to individual, others, society?
- What defines good or worthwhile work?
- What does money have to do with it?
- How do experience, growth, and fulfillment factor in?

*Purpose: Develop work philosophy/manifesto, not job description*

#### Good Time Journal Practice
**Two-Element System**:
1. **Activity Log**: Primary activities and energy levels
2. **Engagement Record**: Where you were energized vs. drained
**Frequency**: 2-3x weekly minimum, daily preferred
**Purpose**: Discover specific motivational patterns and energy sources

### Life Design Areas (Four Domains)
1. **Health**: Mind, body, spirit optimization
2. **Work**: Paid or unpaid meaningful contribution
3. **Play**: Joy-generating activities and experiences
4. **Love**: Affection, community, connection sense

### Three Life Alternatives Exercise

#### Process Steps
1. **Visual Timeline**: Graphical representation of next 5 years
2. **Six-Word Headlines**: Distill each alternative to essence
3. **Learning Questions**: What will this life teach you about yourself?
4. **Resource Dashboard**: Skills, capabilities, contacts, likability, confidence, coherence

#### Anchor Problem Recognition
**Definition**: Problems that hold you in place and prevent motion
**Characteristics**:
- Different from "gravity problems" (unsolvable constraints)
- Often involve perfect solutions that can't work or are too hard
- Psychological component: fear that nothing will work, so easier to stay stuck

**Solution**: Generate multiple alternatives rather than anchoring on one perfect solution
