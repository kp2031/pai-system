# Relationship Management System - Original Concept (2011)

## Core Insight
*"Strong Bonds with people take energy and consistency. You can only do this with a limited number of people."*

This prescient observation from 2011 anticipated many concepts that would later emerge in social technology and relationship science.

## The Vision: TrustMe App

### Relationship Tiers (Dunbar's Number Implementation)
- **Tier 0**: 1-5 people (30min calls, 3+ times/week)
- **Tier 1**: 10-20 people (contact minimum twice monthly)
- **Tier 2**: Up to 100 people (1-2 times yearly reach-out)

### Smart Features
- **Ramped Communication**: Gradual re-engagement with dormant relationships
- **Gift Reminders**: Automated assistant notifications 2 weeks before occasions
- **Post-Call Notes**: Follow-up tracking system
- **Multi-Channel**: Phone, email, text, social networks

### System Functions

#### Collaboration Function
- **Assistant Integration**: Professional relationship management delegation
- **Partner Sharing**: Joint management of mutual relationships (parents, friends)

#### Smart Todo Integration
- **Context-Aware Reminders**: System knows oil change location, auto-generates appointment reminders
- **Non-Human Relationships**: Maintenance tracking for possessions, health, and environment

## Non-Human Relationship Categories (2011 List)
*Remarkably comprehensive system thinking:*

**Financial**: Stocks, credit cards
**Health**: Doctor, dentist, optometrist visits, vaccine boosters
**Home**: Plants, bed sheets, photos, dirty laundry, cleaning supplies
**Automotive**: Oil changes
**Consumables**: Groceries, batteries, soap, detergent, spices
**Entertainment**: PVR watch list
**Organization**: Email inbox, snail-mail

## 2024 PAI Perspective

### What This Got Right
1. **Relationship Energy Management**: Recognized the finite nature of relationship maintenance
2. **Tiered System**: Mapped to Dunbar's number research before it was widely known
3. **Automation + Human Touch**: Balanced efficiency with authenticity
4. **System Thinking**: Extended relationship concepts to all maintenance needs
5. **Gradual Re-engagement**: Sophisticated understanding of social dynamics

### Modern Evolution
This concept predated:
- CRM for personal use (now exists: Clay, Folk)
- Social credit systems
- Relationship banking in business
- AI-powered relationship insights
- The attention economy understanding

### Implementation Relevance Today
The core insight remains valid: **Consistent, intentional relationship maintenance requires systems.** With AI assistance, this vision is now technically feasible and more necessary than ever.

## Applications for Current PAI System
- **Contact Management**: Implement tiered relationship tracking
- **Automation Boundaries**: Identify where AI helps vs. replaces human touch
- **System Maintenance**: Apply non-human relationship thinking to digital systems
- **Energy Allocation**: Use tier system for all life domains, not just relationships

*This 2011 vision represents foundational systems thinking that anticipated many modern social and productivity concepts.*
