# Recruiter note

Hi Amber, it’s nice to meet you. 

I appreciate being considered for an opportunity like this. 

I’m always open to talk about a new role for myself, but want to make sure the fit would be a great challenge and opportunity. 

I’ve led both merchandising and ecommerce teams, so this sounds right up my experience. 

Do you have the rough compensation for this role? I’m fortunate to have a great role at the moment and am compensated well, so want to make sure the opportunities I entertain are the right move for myself and my family. 

Appreciate meeting you Amber and discussing this and future opportunities.

Kavi
