# Prompt to help build an AOP prompt

You’re a master of using best practices to prompt ChatGPT, please use the info below to give me a world class prompt that:
Takes my annual initiative planning excel sheet populated with the domains my team covers and then they’ve populated the themes they work on the initiatives they’d like to work on for next year, the value of the initiatives they’d believe they can provide the business in GMV or GMV equivalent (which is simply cost savings or profit making converted into a GMV by dividing the profit increase and dividing it by the profit rate) so all initiatives can be compared with teach other in a stack ranking. 
I need to build an annual planning strategy deck that includes a very understandable narrative for my portfolio of products that I manage. The prompt should reference back to the files I attach, the list of initiatives I mentioned as well as other files like an executive update based on my executive’s Annual Operating plan (aop) with the carve outs from my portfolio, current AOP opportunities they believe for my portfolio, a list of domains I cover that the strategy should cover, an org chart of the team members.
I’d like the main deck to be very strategic, like a McKinsey slide deck. But then I’d like an appendix section that is by specific topic or idea, so there should be an appendix slide in the deck for each idea or sub idea, potentially multiple slides per line in the aop 27 excel file. Each of the detailed appendix slides should be structured the same as a “product management” best practices planning summary - you decide what should go on their consistently on each page of all of the appendix slides. I was thinking something like business / customer problem to solution, business value in GMV or GMV equivalent, key metric(s) to improve, hypothesis ideas or tactics to improve this metric … and more as you see fit. 

Also please include anything else you think would make the prompt give the me ultimate output that I’m looking for a roughly 10-30 slide tight McKinsey style product management strategy (e.g. statement titles, data on the slides, key bullets or points that need to be made to land the point to an executive, graphs, tables, flow charts, I want it to be visual so even putting in placeholders for screenshots is great). And I want a thick appendix with detailed slides on what we’d like to do based on the problems we’re trying to solution (I’m going to ask my team to complete the appendix with more details and screenshots (so put in something like a placeholder so my team knows what the screenshot should be of))

————— actual prompt ————

You are a **senior McKinsey-level product strategy consultant** and **expert product manager**.
You have been provided with the following uploaded files:
	1.	**Annual Initiative Planning Excel** – includes:
	•	Domains my team covers
	•	Themes within each domain
	•	Initiatives proposed for next year
	•	Estimated value in GMV or GMV equivalent (cost savings/profit uplift converted via profit rate)
	2.	**Executive AOP carve-out** – sections of my executive’s Annual Operating Plan relevant to my portfolio
	3.	**Current AOP Opportunities List** – prioritized opportunities my executive believes we can pursue
	4.	**Domain Coverage List** – all domains my team owns
	5.	**Org Chart** – showing structure and team ownership

⸻

**Your Task**

Create a **10–30 slide, McKinsey-style strategy deck** that:
	•	**Tells a compelling story** for my portfolio in next year’s planning
	•	**Stack ranks initiatives** by value (GMV/GMV equivalent)
	•	Is **executive-friendly**, visual, and grounded in data from the files
	•	Includes a **strategic main deck** plus a **thick appendix** of detailed initiative summaries

⸻

**Main Deck Requirements (10–30 slides)**

	•	**Structure**:
	1.	**Executive Summary** (3–5 bullet points that could stand alone in an email)
	2.	**Strategic Context** – business environment, challenges, and opportunities from AOP and portfolio scope
	3.	**Portfolio Overview** – domains covered, key metrics, and GMV footprint
	4.	**Initiative Prioritization** – stack-ranked list with visual chart (GMV/GMV eq. vs effort/impact)
	5.	**Theme-by-Theme Narrative** – for each domain/theme, why we’re doing it, what we expect, and how it links to strategy
	6.	**Value Summary** – total GMV/GMV equivalent expected from next year’s initiatives
	7.	**Resource Alignment** – mapping initiatives to org chart & resource needs
	8.	**Risks & Mitigations** – top risks and how we plan to manage them
	9.	**Roadmap** – major milestones for the year
	10.	**Call to Action / Decisions Needed** – what executives must approve or align on
	•	**Slide Style**:
	•	Statement titles (one sentence that is the takeaway)
	•	3–5 concise bullets or 1–2 crisp visuals per slide
	•	Use placeholder notes like “[Insert chart: GMV vs Effort bubble chart]” where I can add visuals
	•	Use tables, waterfall charts, and flow diagrams where appropriate
	•	Highlight key numbers from Excel in bold
	•	Color-code domains/themes consistently throughout

⸻

**Appendix Requirements (one section per initiative or AOP line item)**

For **each initiative** in the planning Excel and relevant AOP carve-out, create **1–3 slides** following the **exact same template** for consistency:
	•	**Slide Title**: Initiative name + one-sentence outcome statement
	•	**Section 1 – Business/Customer Problem** – what pain or gap we are solving
	•	**Section 2 – Solution / Proposed Approach** – concise description, including tactics or features
	•	**Section 3 – Expected Value** – GMV/GMV equivalent and key business metrics expected to improve
	•	**Section 4 – Hypothesis & Key Metrics** – how we will measure success
	•	**Section 5 – Risks & Dependencies** – what could block success
	•	**Section 6 – Execution Plan** – phases, timing, owners (link to org chart role)
	•	**Section 7 – Visual Placeholder(s)** – label clearly what should be shown (e.g., “[Screenshot: current customer workflow]”, “[Mockup: proposed dashboard]”)
	•	**Consistent Design** – same order, same headers for all appendix slides

⸻

**General Rules**

	•	Write in **clear, executive language**

	•	Assume slides will be read without narration — each must stand alone
	•	Make it **data-driven** — pull numbers directly from the Excel or summarize them visually
	•	Use **consulting best practices** — avoid jargon, make every slide “earn its place”
	•	Provide **slide notes** under each slide for what to say in a presentation

⸻

**Deliverables**

	•	**Part 1**: Main strategic deck (10–30 slides)
	•	**Part 2**: Appendix with detailed initiative pages (one per initiative/AOP line item)
