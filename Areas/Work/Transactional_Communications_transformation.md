# Transactional Communications transformation 

Excellent. This is a perfect use case for the playbook. A project on transforming transactional communications requires a clear narrative that shows the current problem, a compelling vision for the future, and a credible plan to get there.
Here is a 10-slide deck built from the 40 prompts, tailored specifically to your Walmart Canada project.
The 10-Slide Deck: E-commerce Transactional Communication Transformation
Here are the 10 prompts you should use, in order, with the reasons for their selection.
Slide 1: Project Mandate & Scope
 * Prompt Number: #31
 * Why I Chose It: This is the essential first slide. It aligns everyone on the exact purpose of the project, what you will deliver, and just as importantly, what you will not be doing. It sets the "rules of the game."
The Prompt:
Act as a senior consultant from Walmart's global digital strategy team, presenting in Toronto on Monday, August 4, 2025. We are kicking off a strategic review for the Walmart Canada leadership team.

Your task is to create the "Project Mandate" slide to align on the project's scope and objectives.

The output must be structured as follows:

**Slide Title:** "Mandate: Transform Transactional Communications by Leveraging the Global Platform for the Canadian Market"

**Executive Takeaway:** "This project will deliver a plan to replace our current, disparate e-commerce notifications with a best-in-class, loyalty-building communication stream, adapted from Walmart's global standard for Canadian compliance."

**Body Content (Structured Sections):**
* **Project Objectives:**
    * 1. To increase post-purchase customer satisfaction (NPS) by 15 points.
    * 2. To drive a 5% increase in repeat purchases through personalized, value-added content.
    * 3. To reduce "Where is my order?" (WISMO) calls to customer service by 30%.
* **Key Questions to be Answered:**
    * 1. What are the key gaps between our current Canadian communications and the global standard?
    * 2. What is the business case (investment vs. return) for this transformation?
    * 3. What is the phased roadmap for technical integration and rollout?
* **In Scope:**
    * All post-order transactional emails and SMS (e.g., Order Confirmation, Shipment, Delivery, Return).
    * Integration with Walmart's global communication platform.
    * Personalization and marketing content within these communications.
* **Out of Scope:**
    * Pre-purchase marketing communication (e.g., weekly flyers).
    * In-store communication systems.
    * Foundational changes to the global platform itself.

Slide 2: The Customer Journey Map
 * Prompt Number: #23
 * Why I Chose It: Before you can fix a problem, you must show the pain. This slide visualizes the current, likely inconsistent and purely functional, experience a Walmart Canada customer has after they click "buy," building empathy and creating urgency for change.
The Prompt:
Act as a customer experience (CX) consultant. Your task is to create a Customer Journey Map for a typical Walmart.ca online shopper.

The output must be structured as follows:

**Slide Title:** "Today's Post-Purchase Journey is Functional but Fragmented and Fails to Build a Relationship"

**Executive Takeaway:** "Customers receive a series of disconnected, generic notifications that create anxiety and miss key opportunities to reinforce the value of shopping at Walmart."

**Body Content (Table Format):**
| Stage | Customer Actions & Thoughts | Pain Points üò† | Opportunities üòç |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Order Confirmation**| "OK, they got my order. But when will it ship?" | Generic email, no estimated ship date, lacks excitement. | Reassure with delivery estimates; showcase a relevant "You might also need..." item. |
| **2. Shipment Notification**| "Finally, it shipped. Who is 'APC Logistics'?" | Email comes from a 3rd-party system, tracking link is confusing. | Use Walmart branding consistently; embed a visual tracking map directly in the email. |
| **3. Out for Delivery** | "I got a text, but I'm not home. Can I reroute it?" | No ability to manage delivery options from the notification. | Provide a link to a "Delivery Manager" portal; offer in-store pickup as an alternative. |
| **4. Order Delivered** | "Package is here. Did I get everything?" | Simple text confirmation. No follow-up or next steps. | Send a rich confirmation with images of items ordered; ask for a product review; include a relevant coupon for their next shop. |

Slide 3: The Hypothesis-Driven Slide
 * Prompt Number: #21
 * Why I Chose It: This slide presents your core argument. It moves from "here's the pain" to "here's the fundamental reason why the pain exists." It makes a sharp, debatable point that the rest of the presentation will prove.
The Prompt:
Act as a strategy consultant. Your task is to create a slide that proves a specific hypothesis about Walmart Canada's e-commerce communications.

**Hypothesis:** "Our transactional communications underperform because they are treated as a technical cost center, not a strategic marketing channel leveraging Walmart's global best-in-class assets."

The output must be structured as follows:

**Slide Title:** "Our Communications Underperform Because They Are Treated as a Technical Cost Center, Not a Strategic Marketing Channel"

**Executive Takeaway:** "Analysis shows our purely functional emails have a 90% lower engagement rate than the personalized, content-rich versions used by Walmart US, representing a massive, untapped opportunity to build loyalty and drive revenue."

**Body Content (The Supporting Evidence):**
* **Point 1 (Low Engagement):** "Our Canadian emails have a click-through rate of 0.5%, compared to 5.0% for the US platform's dynamic, content-rich emails."
* **Point 2 (Missed Revenue):** "The US platform drives an average of $0.25 of incremental revenue per order through personalized recommendations in shipping confirmations. Our current system drives $0."
* **Point 3 (Brand Disconnect):** "70% of our shipping notifications are sent from third-party logistics (3PL) domains, diluting the Walmart brand at the peak of customer anticipation."
* **Point 4 (High Cost to Serve):** "Our 'Where is my order?' call volume per 1,000 orders is 80% higher in Canada than in the US, directly attributable to unclear and unhelpful tracking information."

Slide 4: The "From-To" Transformation Slide
 * Prompt Number: #17
 * Why I Chose It: Now that you've established the problem and its root cause, you need to paint a vivid picture of the solution. This slide creates excitement and a clear vision of the desired future state.
The Prompt:
Act as a change management consultant. Your task is to create a "From-To" slide that paints a clear picture of the communication transformation.

The output must be structured as follows:

**Slide Title:** "Our Journey: From Generic Notifications to a Personalized, Value-Added Customer Dialogue"

**Executive Takeaway:** "This transformation is a fundamental shift from sending basic operational updates to creating a continuous, branded conversation that helps customers and strengthens our relationship with them."

**Body Content (in a two-column format):**
| We Are Moving FROM... | We Are Moving TO... |
|---|---|
| **Mindset:** A technical cost to be minimized. | **Mindset:** A strategic asset that builds loyalty. |
| **System:** Fragmented, local, third-party systems. | **System:** A single, global platform with a Canadian localization layer. |
| **Content:** Generic, text-only, functional updates. | **Content:** Rich, visual, personalized with helpful tips & offers. |
| **Experience:** Anxious, uncertain, and inconsistent. | **Experience:** Reassuring, informative, and consistently 'Walmart'. |
| **Metric of Success:** Cost per email sent. | **Metric of Success:** Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) & repeat purchase rate. |

Slide 5: The "Blue Ocean" Value Curve Slide
 * Prompt Number: #19 (Adapted for this context)
 * Why I Chose It: This visually and strategically shows how you will win. Instead of just listing features, it frames the new approach as a fundamental redefinition of what a transactional email is, moving it from a utility to a valuable experience.
The Prompt:
Act as an innovation strategist. Your task is to adapt the Blue Ocean Strategy Canvas to show how the new communication platform will create a new value curve for customers.

The output must be structured as follows:

**Slide Title:** "Redefining the Value of Transactional Communication"

**Executive Takeaway:** "Instead of competing on speed of delivery notifications, we will create a new standard of value by eliminating customer anxiety and creating moments of helpfulness and inspiration."

**Body Content (Strategy Canvas Actions):**
* **Eliminate:**
    * Generic, unbranded 3rd-party notifications.
    * Customer confusion about order status.
* **Reduce:**
    * The need for customers to proactively track packages.
    * The volume of "Where is my order?" calls.
* **Raise:**
    * Brand consistency across all touchpoints.
    * Customer confidence and peace of mind.
* **Create:**
    * A visual, map-based tracking experience.
    * Personalized cross-sell/up-sell opportunities.
    * Helpful content (e.g., recipes for grocery orders, setup guides for electronics).

**Visual Suggestion:** "A line graph ('value curve'). The X-axis lists factors like 'Price', 'Brand Consistency', 'Personalization', 'Helpful Content'. Show two lines: a flat, low 'Industry Standard' line (in red) and a new 'Walmart Canada 2.0' line (in blue) that is low on price but high on the new value-creating factors."

Slide 6: The Technology Architecture (Current vs. Future State)
 * Prompt Number: #38
 * Why I Chose It: This is the "how it works" slide. It directly addresses the user's core constraint‚Äîleveraging a global platform. It shows leadership that this isn't a theoretical dream but a technically sound plan.
The Prompt:
Act as a technology consultant. Your task is to create a slide contrasting the current communication architecture with the proposed future state.

The output must be structured as follows:

**Slide Title:** "Migrating From Disparate Local Scripts to an Integrated Global Communications Platform"

**Executive Takeaway:** "The future architecture allows us to inherit powerful global capabilities instantly while maintaining a flexible 'localization layer' for Canadian-specific legal text, language, and compliance rules."

**Body Content (Two-Column Layout):**
| Current State: "The Patchwork" | Future State: "The Global Platform" |
|---|---|
| **Description:** Multiple, separate systems (e.g., e-commerce platform, warehouse system, 3PL carriers) each trigger their own generic, uncoordinated emails. | **Description:** All order events from Canadian systems feed into a single Global Communications Hub, which intelligently manages the entire communication stream. |
| **Pain Points:** <ul><li>Inconsistent branding and content.</li><li>No central view of what the customer has received.</li><li>Difficult and expensive to make changes.</li></ul> | **Benefits:** <ul><li>Inherit global best-in-class templates, personalization AI, and features.</li><li>Central control and A/B testing capability.</li><li>A "Canadian Content Layer" allows for quick updates to French language, legal disclaimers, and local promotions without touching the core platform.</li></ul>

**Visual Suggestion:** "A 'before and after' diagram. On the left, show multiple chaotic systems pointing directly to the customer. On the right, show those same systems pointing to one central 'Global Comms Hub,' which then points to the customer, with a small box labeled 'Canadian Localization Layer' filtering the communication."

Slide 7: The Recommendation Prioritization Matrix (Impact vs. Effort)
 * Prompt Number: #24
 * Why I Chose It: You can't transform everything overnight. This slide shows a pragmatic, phased approach, demonstrating that you have a plan to get early wins while tackling the bigger challenges.
The Prompt:
Act as a consultant. Your task is to create a slide that prioritizes the rollout across different communication types using an Impact vs. Effort matrix.

The output must be structured as follows:

**Slide Title:** "Our Phased Rollout Will Prioritize High-Impact 'Quick Wins' Like Order & Shipping Confirmations"

**Executive Takeaway:** "We will immediately tackle the most frequent and emotionally important communications‚Äîorder and shipping confirmations‚Äîfor a quick impact on customer satisfaction, while scheduling more complex flows like returns for a later phase."

**Body Content (Quadrant Analysis):**
* **Top-Left (Quick Wins - Low Effort, High Impact):**
    * 1. Order Confirmation Email
    * 2. Shipment Confirmation Email
* **Top-Right (Major Projects - High Effort, High Impact):**
    * 3. Full Returns & Refund Communication Flow
    * 4. "Back in Stock" Notifications
* **Bottom-Left (Fill-ins - Low Effort, Low Impact):**
    * 5. "Review Your Purchase" Emails
* **Bottom-Right (Reconsider - High Effort, Low Impact):**
    * *(Ideally, no initiatives here)*

**Visual Suggestion:** "A 2x2 matrix. Y-axis is 'Customer Impact'. X-axis is 'Implementation Effort'. Place each communication type as a numbered bubble in the appropriate quadrant."

Slide 8: The Financial Projections & Business Case
 * Prompt Number: #8
 * Why I Chose It: This slide answers the critical "So what?" question for any executive: "What's the return on this investment?" It translates the strategic benefits into the language of the CFO.
The Prompt:
Act as a financial analyst. We are proposing an investment of [e.g., "$1.2M"] for the integration project. Create a slide that presents the 3-year business case.

The output must be structured as follows:

**Slide Title:** "Proposed $1.2M Investment is Projected to Deliver a 3x Return and Pay Back in 18 Months"

**Executive Takeaway:** "The investment is financially sound, driven by measurable increases in customer loyalty and incremental revenue, combined with significant operational savings from reduced customer service calls."

**Body Content:**
* **Key Financial Metrics:**
    * **Net Present Value (NPV):** $2.5M
    * **Return on Investment (ROI):** 310% (over 3 years)
    * **Payback Period:** 18 Months
* **Key Value Drivers (Annualized):**
    * **Increased Revenue:** +$900k (from a 5% increase in repeat purchase rate and personalized offers).
    * **Operational Savings:** +$300k (from a 30% reduction in "WISMO" call center volume).
    * **Total Annual Value:** +$1.2M

**Visual Suggestion:** "A combination visual. On the left, use large 'call-out boxes' for the three key metrics (NPV, ROI, Payback). On the right, a simple stacked bar chart showing the two value drivers (Revenue and Savings) adding up to the total annual value."

Slide 9: The Implementation Roadmap
 * Prompt Number: #6
 * Why I Chose It: This slide makes the plan real. It shows the timeline, the key phases of work, and the major milestones, giving leadership confidence that there is a concrete plan for execution.
