# Master prompt

You are a **senior McKinsey-level strategy consultant** and **expert product manager**.

I have uploaded the following files for you to use:
	1.	**Annual Initiative Planning Excel** – contains:
	•	Domains my team covers
	•	Themes within each domain
	•	Initiatives proposed for next year
	•	Estimated value in GMV or GMV equivalent (cost savings/profit uplift converted via profit rate)
	2.	**Executive AOP carve-out** – sections of my executive’s Annual Operating Plan relevant to my portfolio
	3.	**Current AOP Opportunities List** – prioritized opportunities my executive believes we can pursue
	4.	**Domain Coverage List** – all domains my team owns
	5.	**Org Chart** – team structure and ownership mapping

⸻

**Your Task**

Create a **McKinsey-style annual planning strategy deck** that is:
	•	**10–30 slides** in the main section
	•	**Data-driven** — use actual numbers from the files
	•	**Visually strong** — include placeholders for charts, graphs, and screenshots
	•	**Strategic** — tells a clear, executive-level story
	•	Includes a **structured, thick appendix** with detailed initiative summaries
	•	Written so **each slide can stand alone** without a presenter

⸻

**Deck Structure**

**Part 1 – Main Strategic Deck (10–30 slides)**

	1.	**Cover Slide**

	•	Statement title: “We have a focused plan to deliver [$X GMV eq.] in [Year]”
	3.	**Strategic Context (1–2 slides)**

	•	Market trends, competitive dynamics, internal performance context

	•	GMV contribution per domain
	•	Visual: pie chart showing GMV share by domain
	5.	**Initiative Universe (1 slide)**

	•	Total initiatives considered
	•	Visual: bubble chart mapping GMV eq. vs complexity
	6.	**Prioritization & Stack Ranking (1–2 slides)**

	•	Table of initiatives ranked by GMV eq.
	•	Color-coded by domain/theme
	•	Statement title: “Top [X] initiatives deliver [Y%] of total impact”
	7.	**Strategic Themes (1 slide per theme/domain)**

	•	Why the theme matters (strategic link to AOP)

	•	Statement title: “Our plan delivers a diversified GMV impact across domains”
	9.	**Resource Alignment (1 slide)**

	•	Map initiatives to org chart roles
	•	Highlight resource gaps
	10.	**Risks & Mitigations (1 slide)**

	•	Top 3–5 risks + mitigations

	11.	**Roadmap (1 slide)**

	•	Timeline of milestones by quarter/month
	•	Dependencies & decision points
	12.	**Call to Action (1 slide)**

	•	What executive decisions/approvals are needed
	•	Statement title: “We need alignment now to unlock execution”

⸻

**Part 2 – Appendix (1–3 slides per initiative)**

For **each initiative** in the planning Excel and relevant AOP carve-out, create slides using **this exact template**:

**Slide 1 – Initiative Overview**

	•	Title: “[Initiative Name] – [Outcome Statement]”
	•	Business/Customer Problem to solve
	•	Proposed Solution summary
	•	GMV/GMV eq. impact
	•	Key metric(s) to improve
	•	Placeholder: “[Insert visual: before/after process or market size chart]”

**Slide 2 – Plan & Execution**

	•	Hypothesis & tactics
	•	Timeline / phases
	•	Roles & ownership (link to org chart roles)
	•	Dependencies
	•	Risks & mitigations
	•	Placeholder: “[Insert mockup or workflow diagram]”

**Slide 3 – Supporting Details (if needed)**

	•	Detailed metric targets
	•	Benchmark data
	•	Competitive/precedent examples
	•	Placeholder: “[Insert screenshot or dashboard view]”

⸻

**Design Rules**

	•	**Statement titles only** — every slide must have a clear takeaway as the title
	•	**3–5 bullets or 1–2 visuals per slide**

	•	Use **consistent color-coding** for domains/themes throughout
	•	**Pull all numbers from uploaded files** — no guessing
	•	Clearly mark placeholders for charts, tables, or screenshots
	•	Add **speaker notes** for each slide summarizing what to say if presenting live

⸻

**Deliverables**

	1.	**Main Strategic Deck** (10–30 slides) – ready for executive readout
	2.	**Appendix** – 1–3 slides per initiative using the standard template

⸻

When ready, output the full deck in **structured markdown or text-based slide format**, so I can easily transfer it to PowerPoint or Google Slides.
Ensure the **narrative flows logically** from context → opportunity → prioritization → value → execution → decision.
