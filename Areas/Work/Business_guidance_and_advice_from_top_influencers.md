## Frameworks Described in the Video

Below is a concise list and description of the various frameworks shared by Alex Hormozi, Codie Sanchez, and Daniel Priestley in the referenced video, including guidance on when and where to use each.

***

### 1. **MOAT Framework for Business Evaluation**
- **About:** MOAT stands for Margin, Operations, Advantage, and Total Addressable Market. Each is scored 1–10. Businesses with a combined score >30 are “fund it” (great to invest), 20–30 are “fix it” (needs work), <20 are “flee it” (not worth pursuing).
- **When to Use:** Use this to stress-test business ideas, investments, or existing companies to quickly gauge viability and scalability, especially when considering if an idea is worth building or investing in[1].

### 2. **Pain, Passion, Profession (PPP) Framework**
- **About:** Evaluate possible business ideas by checking if they (a) solve a measurable pain, (b) relate to a passion you’re willing to suffer for, or (c) stem from a profession you’re already skilled at.
- **When to Use:** Employ this when brainstorming new business ideas or pivots. PPP helps ensure that your project is meaningful, marketable, and leverages your strengths[1].

### 3. **Sell to the Rich (Affluent Niche Sizing)**
- **About:** Instead of selling small-ticket items to many people, focus on creating value for rich clients who have bigger budgets and typically require less effort yet pay more and complain less. The video suggests targeting the “affluent 9% niche” who both have a meaningful budget and shop based on passion and education.
- **When to Use:** Ideal when launching a consulting, service, or product business. Reposition offers for affluent buyers, or rebrand marketing toward luxury or high-end clientele for higher margins and easier growth[1].

### 4. **Value Metrics Approach to Pricing**
- **About:** Price your services based on: (a) usage, (b) number of users, and (c) quantifiable value delivered. Charging each customer the same price often leaves money on the table—adjust pricing dynamically to value.
- **When to Use:** Use when establishing pricing for SaaS, consulting, or any service/product where clients derive significantly different values or have different usage levels[1].

### 5. **Ideal Close Rate for Pricing**
- **About:** If 7 out of 10 prospects say “no,” your price is likely optimal. Higher close rates (60–80% yes) mean your price is too low; adjust accordingly.
- **When to Use:** Whenever testing new offers or raising prices. Monitor close rates and increase prices until your rejection rate is healthy (about 70% no)[1].

### 6. **Case Study Leveraging for Offer Building**
- **About:** Every strong business draws credibility from one or more specific case studies—founder experience, previous results, or unique knowledge. Leverage these for marketing and positioning.
- **When to Use:** Use when pitching clients, creating offers, and marketing yourself—especially as a founder or service professional. Builds trust and authority[1].

### 7. **Proof Story Outreach Framework**
- **About:** When pitching yourself or reaching out for jobs/clients, use proof stories: “I did something special with a person, got a great result, and can explain the steps.” Make the story visible in the public domain, using unsaturated channels to maximize resonance.
- **When to Use:** Apply this when networking, pitching partnerships, or job searches. Use for direct messages, video outreach, or posting on social media to stand out and earn credibility[1].

### 8. **Repetition & Abundance for Building Confidence**
- **About:** Confidence comes in two ways: repetition (do the thing so much you master it and become unfazed) and abundance (have so many options, you operate with ‘with- or without-you’ energy).
- **When to Use:** Whenever you’re struggling with sales, pitching, or any entrepreneurial endeavor that feels intimidating. Focus on either repetition or generating options to build unshakeable confidence[1].

### 9. **Client Segmentation Pyramid**
- **About:** Segment customers as follows: 1% have 15% of the budget and want pedigree; 9% have 45% of the budget and shop on passion; 90% have 40% of the budget and shop on price. The best niche for growth is the “affluent 9%.”
- **When to Use:** Useful for product/service businesses to decide who to target and position marketing and offers for higher profitability and easier client management[1].

### 10. **Messaging Resonance & Channel Signalness Quadrant**
- **About:** Your outreach (job search, sales, networking) should maximize message resonance (tailored, high-impact) and signalness of the channel (posting or mailing versus crowded inboxes).
- **When to Use:** Whenever cold-outreaching or marketing—craft high-resonance messages and use unsaturated, visible channels for higher response[1].

Each framework is actionable and directly applicable to evaluating, launching, pricing, and scaling a business, with a strong emphasis on targeting clients who can afford premium services, building offers rooted in real experience, and communicating effectively for maximum impact[1].
