**Driving Walmart Canada App Adoption and Deeper Customer Engagement**

**Executive Summary**

Walmart Canada has a significant opportunity to deepen customer relationships by expanding the usage of our mobile app and omnichannel services. Despite growing e-commerce adoption during the pandemic, a 2025 survey shows **nearly 58% of Canadians still shop exclusively in-store with no use of grocery apps**, while only ~2.5% shop exclusively online . This lag in digital engagement (online grocery is ~4.5% of total grocery sales in Canada vs. 10–15% in the U.S. ) highlights a critical gap – and opportunity – for Walmart Canada to lead. By leveraging proven strategies and technologies (many pioneered by Walmart U.S.) and applying *everyday low price* principles (i.e. avoiding gimmicky pricing), we can accelerate app downloads and usage. This will not only drive immediate sales across channels but also build long-term loyalty through increased convenience, personalization, and membership services.

**Our strategy focuses on three pillars:** (1) *Acquire* new app users from our large base of in-store and web-only shoppers by removing friction and highlighting value; (2) *Engage* and convert these users into omnichannel shoppers through seamless digital-physical experiences and targeted incentives (e.g. first free pickup, in-app features in store); and (3) *Deepen Loyalty* by encouraging higher-value behaviors like grocery pickup, delivery adoption, and ultimately membership (e.g. Delivery Pass or Walmart+). Each stage is informed by global best practices and consumer psychology principles, such as the importance of habit formation (getting customers to try new services multiple times), personalized rewards, and reducing perceived risks. The timeline for execution is the next 12 months, aligning with our growth objectives for the coming fiscal year.

**Key expected outcomes** include an accelerated growth in app downloads and active users, more frequent cross-channel shopping trips, higher average spend per customer (as engagement increases), and improved retention via membership conversion. Industry research shows omnichannel customers have significantly higher lifetime value – **up to 30% higher** than single-channel shoppers  – underscoring the financial upside of this strategy. By executing on these pillars, Walmart Canada can close the digital adoption gap versus international peers, set new standards for customer experience in our market, and ultimately reinforce our leadership in everyday value and convenience.

**Customer Segments and Conversion Opportunities**

To craft effective initiatives, we first break down the customer base into key segments along the journey from purely in-store to fully omnichannel. Each segment faces different barriers and motivations, requiring tailored approaches:
	•	**Store-Only Shoppers (Cash or Credit in-store):** These customers shop exclusively in physical stores and **have no Walmart digital account or app**. They may prefer paying with cash or simply haven’t seen a need to go online. **Goal:** Encourage them to create a Walmart.ca account and download the app by demonstrating added value (e.g. easier price comparisons, digital receipts, product availability checks) without compromising their in-store routine. Reducing any distrust of digital (for example, assuring them they can still pay in cash if preferred) and highlighting convenience is key. *Placeholder: [Estimate of the percentage of Walmart Canada shoppers in this segment and their average shopping frequency].*

	•	**Online Web Shoppers (Website-Only):** These customers have a Walmart.ca account and shop on the website (often on desktop or mobile browser) but **have not downloaded or routinely used the mobile app**. **Goal:** Convert them to app users by marketing the app’s superior convenience and features. For example, the app can send real-time order updates, personalize deals, and enable **one-click reorders**, which a web interface may not do as seamlessly. Push notifications about new rollbacks or back-in-stock alerts can create a sense of missing out if they don’t use the app. We will promote app adoption at web checkout (e.g. “Get X for free when you use our app”) – leveraging *commitment bias* once they’re already engaged online.
	•	**New App Downloaders:** Customers who have downloaded the Walmart Canada app but have low activity (they may not be logged in or have yet to make a purchase in the app). **Goal:** Activate these users through first-use incentives and education on app capabilities. For example, upon first login, we can offer a personalized welcome bonus or a tutorial highlighting features like the **store mode** (digital store maps, barcode scanner, etc.). This taps into *curiosity and reward* – users feel they are getting extra perks. Notably, **mobile apps with in-store assistance features can increase user engagement by ~25%**, according to App Annie data . By showcasing features like finding items by aisle and instant price checks, we make the app immediately valuable for in-store visits.
	•	**Omnichannel Initiators (Pickup/Delivery Trialists):** These customers have taken a first step into omnichannel, such as placing a **grocery pickup order via the website** or using a third-party delivery service, but are not regular users and may not be using the app. **Goal:** Encourage repeat usage and migration to the app for these services. A critical insight from industry research is that it often takes a few tries for the convenience to “stick.” In fact, only **42% of first-time online grocery shoppers say the service saved them time, but after three orders 63% recognize the time savings** . This shows that habit formation is key. We will implement “bounce-back” incentives – for example, after a customer’s first pickup order, the app could send a **push notification with a discount or a free item if they place another order within two weeks** . This gentle nudge leverages *reciprocity* (a small reward) and *foot-in-the-door* psychology – having done one pickup, they are more likely to do a second if prompted, which then increases likelihood of a third, solidifying a new habit.
	•	**In-Store App Users (Store-Integrated Shoppers):** Customers who have the app and have even **scanned their Walmart app in-store (Walmart ID)** or used mobile payment, but primarily shop in-store. They are digitally engaged to an extent (likely more tech-savvy), yet might still use the website or app only sparingly for e-commerce. **Goal:** Deepen their app utilization both in-store and online. We will enhance in-store app experiences: for example, Walmart U.S. introduced *Store Mode* with detailed store maps and product locator – mapping over 4,700 stores aisle-by-aisle . This has become one of the **most popular features in the Walmart U.S. app**, helping customers save time finding products during visits. Bringing similar functionality to Walmart Canada (with accurate aisle info and maybe a “check price” scanner) can make the app a must-have companion for any store trip. We expect this to increase store basket size and satisfaction (as **70% of U.S. customers using store pickup end up buying additional items in-store** during collection ). For those already scanning their app for Walmart ID (likely to get e-receipts or to earn any existing rewards), we can further integrate that with personalized suggestions – e.g. after scanning at checkout, the app could show “You might need to restock X soon” or invite them to schedule a delivery for bulky items they bought. This segment is low-hanging fruit for conversion to fuller omnichannel usage since they’ve already embraced some digital tools.
	•	**Regular Pickup Users (Non-App):** Some customers regularly use our **free grocery pickup service via the website** but have not switched to using the app for it. **Goal:** Migrate these loyal pickup customers onto the app and cross-promote other app features. We will highlight that managing orders is more convenient on the app (e.g. easy reorder of weekly staples, real-time substitutions notifications on the go). Also, given these customers already value convenience, we will promote app-only benefits like **mobile check-in for pickup** (which Walmart Canada rolled out in 2020 ) – the app can use GPS or quick user check-in to streamline curbside pickup when they arrive, reducing wait time. Emphasizing time saved (a critical value for these users) and perhaps giving an *exclusive perk for app use* (e.g. an extra $5 off their next pickup when done via app) will encourage the switch. Once on the app, we can then introduce them to other categories available (general merchandise, etc., which they might not have explored).
	•	**Delivery Trialists (Delivery Pass Free Trial members):** Customers who have signed up for a **Delivery Pass free trial** (our equivalent to Walmart+ for grocery delivery). They have shown intent for home delivery convenience but might be early in usage. **Goal:** Ensure they use the app heavily during the trial to demonstrate the full value and ease of the service, increasing the likelihood of converting to paid membership. This includes sending app push reminders to place their **free delivery orders** (leveraging the *loss aversion* principle – “Don’t miss out on using your free delivery benefit this week!”) and showcasing features like **auto-generated shopping lists** to simplify weekly ordering. (Notably, Walmart U.S. has piloted AI-powered shopping list generation to make reordering easier , an idea we should explore as well). The app can also highlight to trial users how much money they’ve saved on delivery fees so far – creating a *sense of value* they would lose if they don’t subscribe.
	•	**Loyal Omni Shoppers (Paid Delivery Pass/Walmart+ members):** Customers who converted their trial into a **paid Delivery Pass membership** (or in future, a Walmart+ membership if introduced). They are our most engaged customers, using multiple services (store, pickup, delivery) and the app regularly. **Goal:** Increase their lifetime value through continued engagement and cross-selling, while retaining their subscription. We will use personalized content in-app – for example, early access to sales or new products, digital grocery planning tools, or integration with other Walmart services (pharmacy, health, financial services) to deepen the ecosystem. *Placeholder: [Potential statistic on membership retention or increased spend]*. U.S. data already shows the potential: **Walmart+ members spend 35% more than non-members on average **, and many of these were captured from competitors (60% of Walmart+ members had been Amazon Prime users ). We aim to replicate this success in Canada by offering distinctive value for members (e.g. fuel discounts at our partners, exclusive app features like scan-and-go checkout, etc., aligned with EDLP ethos of consistent value). Maintaining an excellent app experience will be crucial here – it will serve as the central hub for all their interactions.

*Figure: Distribution of grocery shopping behaviors among Canadian consumers (Feb 2025). Nearly 58% shop entirely in-store (no digital), while only a small fraction are fully online. The majority use a mix but lean towards in-store, indicating a large opportunity to shift more activity into Walmart’s app and online channels .*

These segments illustrate the conversion funnel from a purely store-based customer to a fully engaged omnichannel customer. In the next sections, we outline strategies and investments to move customers through these stages. Each strategy is backed by data and best practices from Walmart U.S. and other markets, while tuned to the Canadian consumer’s needs and preferences.

**Strategy 1: Acquire and Onboard New App Users**

**Objective:** Grow our app user base by converting store-only and website-only customers into app adopters, setting the foundation for ongoing engagement.

**Key Initiatives:**

	•	**Seamless Account Signup & Education:** Simplify the process for in-store shoppers to create a Walmart.ca account and download the app. This includes in-store signage and cashier prompts (e.g. receipts with QR codes to download the app), plus training associates to mention the app’s benefits. We will especially target **customers paying with credit/debit in-store**, since they likely have smartphones and are more inclined to adopt digital tools than cash-only shoppers. The app onboarding will clearly communicate *practical benefits* rather than gimmicks: for example, “Download for an **instant store product locator, digital flyers, and easy reorders**.” We avoid heavy discounting (consistent with EDLP principles), but we can offer *low-cost high-value perks* for first-time signups – such as a **welcome bundle (e.g. free pickup on first order, or $10 off a $50 grocery order)**. This acts as a nudge to try the service without eroding our price image. A McKinsey study emphasizes that personalization and meeting consumer needs is key to winning adoption; indeed **80% of consumers are more likely to purchase when offered a personalized experience **. During signup, we will ask for basic preferences (e.g. dietary or household needs) to immediately personalize app content (making new users feel “this app is for me”).
	•	**Leveraging Psychological Trust Factors:** The Retail Insider survey data shows Canadian shoppers’ hesitations: **nearly 60% want to see & choose fresh products themselves **, and many worry about fees and substitutions. To address this in onboarding, we will emphasize features that give **control and transparency**. For example, the app can allow users to set substitution preferences or communicate with personal shoppers, and we highlight that **pickup is free** (no extra cost) and **delivery fees can be avoided via the pass**. By tackling these trust barriers upfront, we align with Canadians’ value focus. We might include short testimonial quotes or statistics in marketing: e.g. “Join thousands of Canadians who save time with Walmart’s app – with no extra cost on pickup and total control over your order.” (*Social proof* and reassurance).
	•	**In-App Tutorials & “Aha” Moments:** Upon first opening the app, a brief interactive tutorial will showcase key features: searching for an item and seeing its aisle location, scanning a barcode to get price info, building a shopping list, etc. The goal is to get a new user to experience an “aha” moment quickly – e.g., they search “milk” and see not only the price and availability at their store but the exact aisle to find it. This immediate utility can hook even a skeptic. Walmart U.S.’s launch of store maps was hugely successful because it met a real customer need (navigating a 100,000-item supercenter) – **every Walmart store’s layout was mapped in the app, down to aisle and shelf **, making holiday shopping much easier. We expect similar uptake in Canada if we implement this. In fact, Walmart reported that the store maps feature became *one of the most-used features* during the 2018 holiday season, proving that solving basic customer pain points drives app engagement.
	•	**Cross-Channel Promotion:** We will use every touchpoint to promote the app – emails to web shoppers, social media, and in-store announcements. For instance, online grocery orders placed on web will include a prompt: “Get real-time updates on your order with our app.” Store receipts for non-registered shoppers can include a gentle note: “Next time, save time – shop on the Walmart app or online!” We should also explore partnerships (e.g. if customers use our Wi-Fi in-store, a splash screen can suggest downloading the app). Each prompt will focus on convenience and *time savings*, which studies show is the top driver for online grocery preference . The messaging might be, for example: “Skip the line – checkout with your phone” or “Find items in seconds with Walmart app.” These are forward-thinking capabilities (mobile self-checkout, item finder) that signal the app’s value beyond just another way to shop.

By aggressively acquiring new app users through these methods, we enlarge the pool of customers we can engage further. The initial investment (in onboarding UX, associate training, minor incentives) should pay off in higher conversion down the line. We will measure success by the growth in app downloads, **new account creations (especially from in-store customers)**, and the rate of first orders through the app. A key metric will be the percentage of store-only shoppers who sign up and make at least one digital purchase within the 12-month plan period [**Placeholder: target X% conversion**].

**Strategy 2: Engage and Convert to Omnichannel Usage**

Once customers have the app or an online account, the next step is to **integrate the app into their regular shopping habits** and encourage use of Walmart’s omnichannel services (pickup, delivery, etc.). The goal here is to increase the frequency of engagement and broaden the range of services each customer uses – moving from single-channel to multi-channel shoppers, who tend to spend more and stay more loyal. This section outlines how we will drive that engagement through **seamless experiences and targeted incentives**:

**Key Initiatives:**

	•	**Enhance the In-Store App Experience:** A critical differentiator for Walmart is the ability to blend digital and physical. We will bring **Walmart U.S.-style “Store Mode” features** into the Canadian app to make it indispensable during store visits. This includes detailed store maps with product search (so a user can search an item, and a pin drops on the map showing the aisle – already live in U.S. with great success ), as well as a built-in barcode scanner for price checks and product info. (For example, scanning a product in-store could show online reviews or alternate sizes available online, encouraging a later online purchase if not found in store). These features reduce friction in shopping – an aspect customers love. App engagement data suggests that when apps offer useful in-store tools, **customers are significantly more engaged (25% more, as noted earlier) ** and more likely to keep the app on their phones. Our investment here involves updating our product databases and store layout info, but it aligns perfectly with our omnichannel vision. We will pilot these features in a few large stores, communicate the availability (e.g. signage: “Use our app to find any item in this store!”), and iterate based on feedback.
	•	**Frictionless Cross-Channel Journeys:** We must ensure that moving between channels (store, app, website) is seamless. One example is **digital shopping lists**: customers can create a grocery list in the app and then *toggle to see which items are available for online order vs. in-store*. If a customer prefers to go in person, the app list can guide them aisle by aisle; if they run out of time, with one tap they could convert the list into a curbside pickup order. Another example is connecting **in-store purchases to the app** – after an in-store trip (if the customer scans their Walmart ID barcode at checkout), the app can log those items in purchase history. This gives us data to later prompt reorders (“You bought cereal two weeks ago, ready to buy again?”) and provides customers the convenience of e-receipts and easy returns. It also sets the stage for personalized suggestions (respecting privacy, but leveraging their purchase patterns). We know from McKinsey research that **retailers who excel at personalization across channels see higher customer engagement and loyalty** – personalization investments can *increase customer spending by 15–20%* . Our app will use that purchase history to personalize home screens (e.g. show frequently bought items for quick add) and tailor promotions (e.g. if a customer always buys baby products in-store, show them app promotions for diapers with pickup discount). This encourages them to consider the app not just for browsing but as a shopping tool.
	•	**Promote Grocery Pickup and Delivery with Incentives:** To convert app users into **omnichannel order users**, we will use time-limited incentives that align with EDLP (i.e., focus on *free services or one-time benefits* rather than ongoing discounts). One flagship offering is **“First grocery pickup free”** – Walmart Canada already offers free pickup as a baseline, but the incentive here is more about *try it and get something for free*. For instance, we could offer **an extra $10 off their first pickup order over $50 via app** (this is a reasonable basket size to encourage a full shop). For those who have done pickup but not delivery, **offer a free trial of Delivery Pass for a month** through the app. Essentially, we lower the barrier to try each service: *click-and-collect* and *home delivery*. Research has shown that **convenience is the overwhelming draw for online channels **, so once a customer experiences the ease of pickup or delivery (especially without fees initially), they are likely to repeat it if the experience is good. We will time these offers strategically: for example, right before a busy holiday or long weekend (when convenience is at a premium) we’ll remind app users “Skip the holiday rush – try Free Pickup for the first time” with the incentive. Importantly, after the first use, **we follow up to encourage the second and third use** (as noted, habit forms by the third purchase). This could be done via an email or notification: “Thank you for your first pickup order! Enjoy a free item (or X% off) on your next one.” These *graduated incentives* train the behavior without becoming a permanent discount. Our hypothesis (supported by Bain’s findings ) is that investing in those first 2–3 orders yields a long-term customer.
	•	**Improve Online Assortment and Information:** One barrier some customers have is that they feel the need to go in-store to see the products (freshness, or simply browsing preference). We can mitigate this by enriching the app experience: high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and even user reviews/ratings for grocery items. Walmart U.S. has started to integrate customer ratings on grocery items online, which helps build trust in substituting the in-person scrutiny. Additionally, features like **“expiration date guidance”** were mentioned in global examples (Tesco in the UK shows how long produce will stay fresh ) – implementing something similar could address the freshness concern. While we might not have exact dates, even indicating “Usually good for 5+ days” on produce could reassure an online buyer. By making the app’s product info rich, we reduce the psychological gap between seeing in person vs. online. This addresses *uncertainty avoidance*, an important principle: the more we can reduce uncertainty (about quality, fit, etc.), the more likely a customer is to transact digitally.
	•	**Leverage Social and Community Features:** As a forward-looking idea, we can consider adding community elements to the app to deepen engagement. Walmart U.S. experimented with a **“Shop with Friends” social feature **, allowing groups of family or friends to collaborate on shopping lists or share recommendations. In a Canadian context, this could be promoted to young families (e.g. spouses sharing a grocery list, or an elderly parent and adult child coordinating shopping). This kind of feature taps into *social proof* and fun, making the app more than a transaction tool – it becomes part of the shopping routine socially. While this is a newer concept, it could differentiate us in the market if executed well.

Overall, **engagement metrics** we will track include: active app users (weekly/monthly active), frequency of orders per app user (are they increasing over time), and the mix shift of orders (more orders via app vs. web, more pickup/delivery vs. pure in-store). We also expect **basket sizes to grow** as customers adopt online for stock-up trips (data from other markets suggests omnichannel shoppers tend to have larger baskets per order, as they plan more ). Another KPI is attachment rate of cross-category purchases – e.g. a customer who used to only buy general merchandise now also buys groceries online, or vice versa, indicating the app is facilitating broader shopping.

Finally, by engaging customers across channels, we strengthen their loyalty. They invest time in building lists, getting used to our ecosystem – making them less likely to switch to a competitor. This lays the groundwork for the next stage: truly locking in loyalty through membership and subscription value.

**Strategy 3: Deepen Loyalty with Membership and Expanded Services**

The ultimate level of customer engagement is when shoppers not only use our app and services frequently, but also become **members** of our ecosystem – akin to Walmart+ in the U.S. or our Delivery Pass for Walmart Canada. At this stage, the focus is on **increasing lifetime value and retention**. We want to reward our best customers with even better experiences, and in turn capture a greater share of their wallet. This strategy builds on the previous two: once customers trust and regularly use the app, presenting a membership proposition can be very compelling (where earlier it might have been premature).

**Key Initiatives:**

	•	**Scale Up the Delivery Pass (and Explore Walmart+ for Canada):** Currently, Walmart Canada’s **Delivery Pass** offers unlimited deliveries for a fee (with a free trial to start). We will double down on converting trial users to paid subscribers. Tactically, this means *engaging users throughout their free trial period*: sending reminders of how much they’ve saved in delivery fees so far (making the value tangible) and highlighting upcoming features they could miss if they leave. For example, “As a Delivery Pass member, you could get early access to our Black Friday online deals via the app” – an idea to add exclusive perks beyond free delivery. We know from experience that once customers subscribe, their purchase frequency and loyalty jump. Walmart’s internal data in the U.S. showed **Walmart+ members spend 35% more than non-members **, indicating that the membership not only locks in their grocery spend, but also increases cross-category shopping (due to free shipping and other benefits). Our aim is to replicate this: by the end of the next 12 months, convert a significant portion of active delivery users into paid members [**Placeholder: target number of paid Delivery Pass members**]. If feasible, we will also assess launching a broader **Walmart+ program in Canada** (perhaps bundled with other benefits like fuel savings or partner offers) to further solidify loyalty. Any such program would be communicated as *value-enhancing* (consistent savings and convenience) rather than a premium upcharge. This aligns with everyday low price philosophy by giving members ongoing value for a predictable fee.
	•	**Exclusive App Features for Members:** To encourage sign-ups and continued app usage, certain high-value features can be reserved for members (or at least first available to them). For instance, **Mobile Scan-and-Go** checkout is a feature Walmart U.S. offered to Walmart+ members – using the app to scan items in-store and skip the checkout line. This is a perfect example of a tech-enabled perk that saves time (a currency just as important as money for many shoppers). If we can introduce Scan-and-Go in some Canadian stores for Delivery Pass/Walmart+ members, it would both entice sign-ups and keep members opening the app on every store visit. Another idea is **members-only promotions or content**: perhaps recipe planning tools that integrate with shopping lists, or a free monthly product sample added to a delivery for members. These play into *loyalty psychology* – giving a sense of status or belonging to members, which increases their emotional commitment to Walmart. We will be careful to ensure non-members still have a great experience (since Walmart’s brand is inclusive), but subtle differentiation can drive the perceived value of membership.
	•	**Continuous Personalization and Communication:** As customers become more engaged, we accumulate more data on their preferences. We will use this responsibly to further personalize their experiences. That means the app home screen for a loyal member might show a “Your usual weekly basket – one tap to re-order” and proactively offer substitutions or new suggestions in the brands they like (e.g. a new organic product similar to one they buy). It could also mean personalized **push notifications** that are genuinely useful – “It’s going to snow this weekend; your frequently bought heating supplies are in stock if you want to order for pickup” – rather than generic ads. When done well, personalization makes customers feel understood and valued, which strengthens loyalty. *(A BCG report on loyalty notes that customers expect more than just points – they want relevant, personalized benefits . We will deliver that via our app.)* Additionally, we will solicit feedback from our members through in-app surveys or a feedback hub. Giving them a voice closes the loop and reinforces that Walmart listens, which builds an emotional bond.
	•	**Expand Ecosystem Services:** To deepen relationships, consider services beyond retail that can be integrated into the app in Canada. Walmart U.S. has ventured into health clinics, financial services, etc., accessible via the Walmart app. In Canada, we might not have all those yet, but we can start with simpler add-ons: e.g. **pharmacy prescriptions refills via app**, or integration with our 3rd-party partner services. For example, if a customer uses our app regularly for grocery, we could partner with a local recipe/meal-planning app to offer an integrated meal planner that directly adds ingredients to Walmart cart. These ecosystem plays increase the *stickiness* of the app – it becomes central to not just shopping but solving everyday needs. The more touchpoints we have, the harder it is for customers to switch to a competitor. McKinsey observes that **leading grocers globally are building ecosystems to lock in loyalty and generate new revenue streams  **. Walmart’s own ecosystem approach (health, financial, marketplace, etc.) has yielded higher customer engagement and even higher investor valuation . While at Walmart Canada we will proceed carefully, even incremental steps in this direction (like a loyalty partnership for fuel or a co-branded financial product accessible via the app) could differentiate us in the Canadian market.
	•	**Delivering Consistent EDLP Value:** Throughout our loyalty strategy, we must maintain Walmart’s promise of everyday low price. That means our app and membership benefits will focus on **consistent savings and convenience** rather than ephemeral promotions. For example, rather than a complex points scheme (which we are avoiding, aside from whatever Walmart+ might include), we offer *low prices daily, but with enhanced service*. This is something our competitors (who often rely on promotional pricing or loyalty points) might not match. We will communicate to customers that using the Walmart app and membership doesn’t mean you pay more – in fact, it helps you **save more time and money** by not needing to shop around. One supporting point: Walmart Canada already dropped the minimum order for free pickup from $50 to $35 in 2020 , showing our commitment to accessible convenience. We carry that forward by ensuring, for example, that **delivery pass pays for itself after a certain number of orders** (we can explicitly calculate and show that to users). By reinforcing that Walmart saves them money *and* time (a dual value proposition), we hit both rational and emotional drivers of loyalty.

**Expected Outcomes:** A successful execution of this loyalty deepening strategy means higher retention and share of wallet. Specifically, we expect an **increase in average spending per customer** among those who adopt membership or multiple services, as indicated by U.S. benchmarks (e.g. Walmart+ 35% lift ). We also anticipate a **reduction in churn** – customers who use at least two channels (store + app, or pickup + delivery, etc.) are much less likely to stop shopping with Walmart entirely, because they are more embedded in our ecosystem. We will measure member renewal rates, the uptake of Delivery Pass after trial, and perhaps Net Promoter Score (NPS) for our app and services among these power users. Another key metric is **delivery adoption rate**: how many of our regular pickup customers we can graduate to also trying delivery (since delivery often drives more frequent orders due to its convenience). If we see a steady increase in delivery orders per user and conversion to paid subscriptions, it will validate our approach.

Moreover, by leading in these services, Walmart Canada can position itself as a *digital grocery leader in the country*. This has strategic value beyond immediate sales – it can open opportunities like retail media (more app usage = more eyeballs for potential advertising partnerships) and even B2B services (e.g. selling our fulfillment capabilities). It also future-proofs our business against purely online competitors by leveraging our store network as an asset (e.g. faster local fulfillment for members).

**Global Insights and Canadian Context**

Throughout this plan, we have woven in learnings from Walmart U.S. and other markets, as well as external research. To summarize a few critical insights that underpin our strategy:
	•	**Omnichannel is Critical, Not Optional:** The pandemic accelerated digital adoption, and while Canada trails some peers, the trajectory is clear. Grocery e-commerce is expected to continue growing (North American grocery executives foresee penetration doubling in the next 3-5 years ). Retailers that invested in omnichannel earlier (US, UK, etc.) are now reaping loyalty benefits. In Canada, there is a *window of opportunity* now to capture customers as they slowly shift habits. If not us, they may eventually go to competitors or third-party platforms. Our plan ensures Walmart is the one to lead them into the digital age. McKinsey’s 2023 industry report noted **“omnichannel is no longer a nice-to-have but a critical offering” and the most successful grocers invest in seamless, personalized experiences across channels **. We are aligning with that principle.
	•	**Consumer Behavior Can be Changed with the Right Value Proposition:** The Canadian reluctance to online grocery (stemming from desire to see products and avoid fees  ) can be addressed by our approach: free pickup (no fees), generous substitution policies, and quality guarantees can alleviate concerns. Other Western countries have made this shift – e.g., UK consumers embraced online grocery to the point it’s mainstream, thanks in part to innovations like green timestamp labels for freshness and highly efficient click-and-collect options. In the U.S., once COVID forced trial, many consumers stuck with it: experts noted that **once a customer downloads an app and learns to shop online, it becomes easier to repeat and the behavior often sticks **. Our task is to get them to that point of familiarity through repeated positive experiences.
	•	**Technology and Innovation as Enablers:** New tech like **AI and automation** are not just buzzwords; they directly support our goals. For example, **generative AI** can be used to create smart shopping lists (as Walmart U.S. is doing ) and answer customer questions via chat – making the app a 24/7 assistant. Automation in fulfillment (micro-fulfillment centers, as Walmart Canada has started investing in  ) will improve the speed and accuracy of pickup and delivery orders, leading to better customer satisfaction. We will continue to invest in these areas (perhaps piloting an AI chatbot in the app for product questions or meal planning). As another forward-looking example, Walmart has even looked into **virtual reality shopping to mimic the in-store browsing experience ** – while that’s experimental, it shows the level of innovation on the horizon. We will keep an eye on such technologies to maintain our competitive edge.
	•	**Competitive Landscape and Differentiation:** In Canada, major grocers and retailers are also pushing apps and loyalty (e.g., Loblaw’s PC Optimum and app, Amazon’s increasing grocery presence with Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh). Walmart’s differentiator is our **Everyday Low Price** promise combined with broad assortment. We won’t win by out-couponing the competition – we’ll win by integrating low prices into a superior customer experience. Our strategy heavily emphasizes convenience and time savings without making customers pay a premium for it (unlike some competitors who require paid memberships just to get free pickup, etc.). This is a subtle but important point for our customers. It builds trust that Walmart’s digital evolution is *on their side* (saving them money/time) rather than a way to extract more fees. Maintaining this trust will be crucial for adoption, as Canadian consumers can be value-conscious and even skeptical. By the end of 12 months, we want the narrative to be: **“Walmart has the best grocery app experience in Canada, and it doesn’t cost extra to use it”** – which will resonate strongly with everyday families.

**Investment Thesis and KPIs**

**Investment Requirements:** To execute this plan, investments will be needed in technology (app development for new features like store maps, scan-and-go, AI list recommendations), data integration (connecting point-of-sale, inventory, and online systems for real-time info), and marketing (incentives, campaigns to promote the app and services). We will also invest in training and possibly additional staffing for omnichannel operations (more personal shoppers as delivery/pickup orders increase, etc.). Fortunately, many of these are extensions of ongoing initiatives – for instance, Walmart Canada’s recent $110M omnichannel investment laid groundwork by expanding pickup locations and enabling mobile check-in . Our plan builds on that momentum. The thesis is that **these investments will pay off through increased customer lifetime value and market share**:
	•	By converting more customers to use multiple channels, we get more of their total spend. (Customers who use both in-store and online with us will buy less from competitors).
	•	Digital engagement also unlocks new revenue streams (e.g., retail media advertising on the app to suppliers, which is growing rapidly in retail).
	•	Efficiency gains: digital orders can be more efficient to handle at scale, especially as we optimize fulfillment. Also, an engaged app user can serve themselves (like finding products or doing self-checkout), saving associate time that can be redirected to service or picking online orders. This can improve operating cost leverage in the long run.

**Key Hypotheses to Test:**

	1.	*If we introduce robust in-store app features (maps, scanning), then a significant share of store shoppers will adopt the app for in-store use,* leading to higher store basket sizes and more app downloads. (We expect to see increased app usage within stores and positive feedback about easier shopping trips.)
	2.	*If we incentivize first and second uses of pickup/delivery, then new users will become repeat users,* increasing the online grocery order frequency. We hypothesize a **considerable uplift in 4-week repeat rate** for those given a bounce-back incentive vs. those who are not .
	3.	*If we promote Delivery Pass effectively during trial, then trial conversion to paid will increase*, boosting our membership base. Our hypothesis is that by highlighting savings and offering excellent service during the trial (no out-of-stock or late deliveries), we can achieve a conversion rate exceeding industry norms [Placeholder: e.g. aim for >30% conversion from trial to paid].
	4.	*If we provide personalized recommendations and content, then customer satisfaction and average spend will rise.* We’ll measure engagement with personalized features (click-through rates on recommended items, etc.) and correlate with basket size. Success would validate studies like McKinsey’s finding on personalization driving up spend .
	5.	*If we maintain an EDLP approach in digital (no significant fees, transparent pricing same as in-store), then customers will not see digital as a “premium” channel,* mitigating risk of drop-off after trial incentives. We’ll monitor any feedback or churn related to pricing perceptions. We expect loyalty to strengthen as customers realize the app is a true extension of the Walmart value they trust.

**Metrics and Timeline:** Over the 12-month execution, key KPIs will be tracked quarterly:
	•	**App Downloads & Active Users:** aiming for a steep increase in Q1–Q2 as marketing pushes, then steady growth.
	•	**Digital Penetration:** % of Walmart Canada shoppers who have used online or app in last 6 months (target to significantly grow this from current baseline ).
	•	**Order Volume by Channel:** growth in pickup and delivery orders (with an eye on maintaining in-store traffic – the goal is omnichannel growth, not shifting existing sales online at the expense of stores). We expect net growth as basket expansion and new occasion captures (e.g., an extra small mid-week order someone wouldn’t have done if not for easy delivery).
	•	**Membership Sign-ups and Renewals:** number of Delivery Pass subscriptions (free trial starts and paid) and their renewal rates after 12 months.
	•	**Customer Satisfaction/Feedback:** via app store ratings, post-order surveys, etc. Ideally, improvements here as convenience enhancements roll out.
	•	**Financial Metrics:** incremental sales and gross profit from digital channels, attachment rate of general merchandise in grocery orders and vice versa (indicating cross-sell), and operational metrics like fulfillment cost per order (as volume increases and we optimize picking).

Each investment (feature launch or incentive program) will be evaluated against these metrics to iterate quickly. For example, if a certain incentive isn’t driving repeat usage as expected, we will tweak the offer or timing. If store map usage is low, we will revisit the UX or promotion of it. Agile, test-and-learn approaches – much like leading tech companies – will be employed, consistent with the “software-driven innovator” mindset McKinsey advocates for retailers  .

**Conclusion**

In summary, by breaking down the problem and opportunity in a structured way – from acquiring app users to engaging them in new behaviors and ultimately fostering loyalty – we have a clear roadmap to drive growth. This plan is grounded in **proven best practices** (both from consulting research and Walmart’s own experiences globally) and tailored to the Canadian consumer context. It respects Walmart’s DNA of everyday low price while pushing into the future with technology and innovation.

As a product management leader at Walmart Canada, my perspective is that success in the next year will not be defined solely by how many more downloads we get, but by how deeply we integrate Walmart into our customers’ lives through the app and services. When a busy parent in Toronto instinctively opens the Walmart app to plan dinner, locate a product in-store, or schedule a grocery pickup – rather than thinking of any competitor – that is when we know we’ve built a deeper relationship. Achieving that across millions of Canadians is ambitious, but entirely achievable with the assets we have: a trusted brand, a vast store network, and now a suite of digital tools that can bring it all together.

The time is ripe to close the gap with (and even surpass) the digital experiences seen in the US, UK, and other markets. By executing this plan over the next 12 months, Walmart Canada can position itself at the forefront of retail innovation in Canada, drive significant app adoption, and most importantly, create **lifelong Walmart customers** in an era where loyalty is harder and harder to earn. The investment in our omnichannel capabilities is an investment in the future growth and resilience of our business. Let’s make Walmart Canada the benchmark for connected retail in this country, delivering convenience and value to our customers wherever they are – in-store, on the web, or on our app.
