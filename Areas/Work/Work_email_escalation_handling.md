# Work email escalation handling

Work email escalation handling 

**Refined Setup**

**1. Updated Delivery Method**

We’ll modify the scheduled task prompt so that instead of emailing you, it simply delivers the summary and suggested responses as a message right within your ChatGPT environment. This way, you’ll just see it as part of your ongoing chat each morning.

**2. Adding the Team Member Accountability File**

We’ll create a new CSV file that lists your team members and their roles or areas of responsibility. That way, when ChatGPT is drafting a response, it can look at the context of the email and automatically include the right team member if a certain type of expertise is needed.

⸻

**New File: Team Member Roles (.csv)**

This file will have one column for the team member’s name and another for their area of responsibility.

⸻

**Filename:** Team_Roles.csv

**Contents:**

`Team Member,Responsibility`
`Sneha Sharma,Account Security`
`Liam Johnson,Client Relations`
`Ava Patel,Project Management`
`Noah Kim,Technical Support`
`Olivia Chen,Marketing and Communications`
`Lucas Brown,Product Development`
`Emma Wilson,Human Resources`
`Mia Davis,Finance and Budgeting`
`Ethan Thompson,Logistics and Operations`
`Sophia Martinez,Legal and Compliance``
`

**Updated Scheduled Task Prompt**

Here’s an updated version of the prompt to include both the new file and the refined delivery method:

⸻

**Scheduled Task Prompt for ChatGPT**

Please create a scheduled task that runs every morning at 8 a.m. This task should do the following:
	1.	Load the VIP list from the file VIP_List.csv to identify whose emails and Teams messages should be included in the summary.
	2.	Refer to the drafting instructions in the file Drafting_Instructions.docx for guidance on how to create suggested responses.
	3.	Use the Team_Roles.csv file to identify which team members should be included in the response based on the topic of the email (for example, include the account security lead for security-related issues).
	4.	Deliver the summary and suggested responses as a message directly within ChatGPT, so I can review it here each morning.

⸻

With this refinement, you’ll have a comprehensive system. Each morning you’ll get a message in ChatGPT with the latest VIP summaries, the right team members included, and responses drafted according to your instructions. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to tweak!
