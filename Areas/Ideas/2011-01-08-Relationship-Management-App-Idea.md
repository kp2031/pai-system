## Original Concept

### Core Vision
"Helping you to stay on top of relationships that matter to you"

The fundamental insight: **Strong bonds with people take energy and consistency, and you can only do this with a limited number of people.**

### Version 1: Personal Relationship Management
- Call reminders, email notes, texts, social networks integration
- Build "double bonds" with people
- Focus on consistency in relationship maintenance

### Version 2: "TrustMe" Business App
**Key Features:**
- **Gift reminders** - automated reminders to assistant 2 weeks before occasions
- **Gradual re-engagement** - slowly ramp up communications based on relationship distance
- **Professional vs Personal** - photos in "additional notes" for business, front-and-center for personal
- **Post-call notes** - capture follow-up items and insights
- **Gamification** - unlock features through usage, alternative paid/ad-supported model

**Proposed Add-ons:**
- To-do list integration
- Calendar integration
- Collaboration/delegation tools
- Non-human relationship tracking

### "Non-Human Relationships" Innovation
Brilliant expansion: maintaining connections with "things that die if ignored"

**Categories identified:**
- **Financial**: stocks, credit cards
- **Health**: doctor/dentist/optometrist visits, vaccine boosters
- **Home maintenance**: plants, bed sheets, cleaning supplies, appliances
- **Personal care**: shoe polishing, dry cleaning
- **Digital hygiene**: email inbox, PVR watch list
- **Consumables**: groceries, batteries, soap, spices

## 2024 Perspective & Analysis

### Market Evolution
This idea predicted several major trends:
- **CRM democratization** - tools like Notion, Airtable now enable personal CRM
- **Relationship intelligence** - LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Clay.com
- **Life automation** - IFTTT, Zapier, iOS Shortcuts
- **Subscription everything** - automatic restocking services

### Modern Solutions That Exist
- **Personal CRM**: Clay, Folk, Dex, Monica
- **Habit tracking**: Streaks, Habitica, Apple Health
- **Home management**: Amazon Subscribe & Save, grocery delivery apps
- **Professional networking**: LinkedIn, Calendly, Mixmax

### What's Still Missing
1. **Unified relationship + life management** - no single app does both well
2. **Contextual re-engagement algorithms** - most tools are binary on/off
3. **Cross-domain insights** - connecting relationship health to life maintenance
4. **Emotional intelligence layer** - understanding relationship dynamics

### Modern Technical Implementation
**2024 Stack:**
- **AI/ML**: LLMs for relationship insights, notification timing optimization
- **Integrations**: Zapier/IFTTT for automation, calendar APIs, contact sync
- **Mobile-first**: iOS/Android apps with push notifications
- **Data sources**: Social media APIs, email, calendar, purchase history
- **Privacy**: Local-first storage, end-to-end encryption

### Updated Business Model
- **Freemium SaaS** - basic relationship tracking free, AI insights premium
- **API marketplace** - integrate with existing tools (Notion, Calendly, etc.)
- **Enterprise edition** - team relationship management for sales/success teams

## Modern Relevance Score: 9/10

This idea was remarkably prescient. The "non-human relationships" concept alone could be a standalone business today. The core insight about relationship maintenance requiring intentional systems remains deeply relevant in our hyper-connected but paradoxically isolated world.

## Potential 2024 Execution
Consider building as:
1. **Notion template** - test market demand with no-code solution
2. **iOS Shortcuts collection** - automate specific workflows
3. **AI-powered assistant** - ChatGPT plugin or custom GPT for relationship coaching
4. **Integration layer** - connect existing tools rather than replacing them
